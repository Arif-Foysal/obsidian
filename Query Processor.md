A query processor is a component of a database management system (DBMS) that is responsible for processing user queries. It takes a query in a high-level language, such as SQL, and translates it into a low-level language that can be executed by the DBMS. The query processor also performs optimization on the query to find the most efficient way to execute it.

The query processor typically consists of four sub-components:

- **The parser** parses the query and ensures that it is syntactically correct.
- **The optimizer** generates an execution plan for the query. The execution plan specifies how the query will be executed, including the order in which the tables will be scanned and the join conditions that will be used.
- **The executor** executes the execution plan and returns the results of the query to the user.
- **The rewriter** rewrites the query to improve its performance. For example, the rewriter may rewrite a join query as a series of simpler queries.

The query processor is a critical component of a DBMS. It is responsible for ensuring that queries are executed correctly and efficiently.

Here are the 4 steps of query processing:

1. **Parsing and translation:** The query processor first parses the query and translates it into an internal representation. This representation is then used by the other components of the query processor.
2. **Optimization:** The query optimizer generates an execution plan for the query. The execution plan specifies how the query will be executed, including the order in which the tables will be scanned and the join conditions that will be used.
3. **Evaluation:** The query executor executes the execution plan and returns the results of the query to the user.
4. **Execution engine:** The execution engine is responsible for executing the low-level instructions that are generated by the query processor.

The query processor is a complex component of a DBMS. However, it is essential for ensuring that queries are executed correctly and efficiently.
