A database model is a conceptual representation of how data is stored in a database. It is a high-level view of the database that does not consider the physical storage of the data.
## Types of Data Models
### High Level Conceptual Data Model
A high-level conceptual data model is a representation of the data in a system that is close to the way that the data is perceived by the users. It is a high-level view of the data that does not consider the physical storage of the data.
It includes-
- [[Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)]]
- [[Object Oriented Model]]
### Record Based Logical Data Model
A record-based logical data model is a representation of the data in a system that is based on the idea of records and fields. A record is a collection of related data items, and a field is a single data item. The record-based logical data model is a more detailed view of the data than the conceptual data model, but it still does not consider the physical storage of the data.
It includes-
- [[Relational Model]]
- [[Hierarchical Model]]
- [[Network Model]]
### Physical Data Model
A physical data model is a representation of the data in a system that considers the physical storage of the data. The physical data model specifies the data types of the fields, the relationships between the records, and the physical layout of the data on disk.
