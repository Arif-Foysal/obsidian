Good Morning everyone. Today we are here to present our ideas on the project Health Stream, which is a medical inventory management system that aims to manage medical assets efficiently.
## Users and Authentication
System will Allow patients to register with the system by providing a combination of required and optional information's. The system will provide authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the blood bank management system.
## Blood Demand
There is a constant demand for blood in medical facilities. A recent study shows that the medical demand for blood in Bangladesh is nine lakh bags annually and about 32% of nations blood supply come from voluntary donation, and the remaining comes from relatives and friends of the patients. However, many hospitals and healthcare facilities preserve blood to ensure patient safety and the effective use of blood products in medical treatments.

### Blood Inventory Management
- Blood Database
	- The system will have a comprehensive database of all available blood products, including whole blood, red blood cells, platelets, plasma, and other specialized components. The database will store important details such as blood type, donor information, expiration dates, and testing results.
- Blood inventory tracking
	- The system will provide a inventory tracking feature that tracks blood product quantities in real-time, updating the inventory automatically with each transaction (donations, transfusions, discards, etc.). This will Ensure that stock levels are always accurate to avoid stock outs or wastage.
- Search Feature
	 We will implement a search feature that allows patients and staff to search the database to check the availability of specific blood types in the inventory.
- **Low stock & expiration alert:**
	We will implement automatic alerts for blood products approaching their expiration dates, enabling proactive management and disposal if necessary.
	
### Ambulance Management
- Ambulance Database & Management
	The database will Store details about each ambulance, such as ID, registration number, make, model, and capacity.
	This will help Tracking the availability status of each ambulance such as available, dispatched, in-service, unavailable.
- Real time location tracking 
	Real time location tracking will improve operational efficiency, saves valuable time, and ultimately contributes to better patient care and outcomes in emergency situations.
### Medicine Inventory Management
- **Drug Information Database:**
- **Real time inventory tracking**
- **Expiry Date Tracking:**
- **Automated Reorder Alerts:**
- **Drug Usage Analytics:**

==Script==
- **Drug information database:** The system will have a database of all available drugs, including details like drug name, generic name, price, manufacturer, dosage form, and packaging.
- **Real time inventory tracking:** This will keep track of every drug being sold and update the database accordingly. A bill will be generated after each sell.  
- **Expiry Date Tracking:** System will record expiration dates for each drug to ensure proper rotation of stock and prevent dispensing expired medications.
- **Automated Reorder Alerts:** We will set up automatic notifications for low-stock or critical stock items.
- **drug usage analytics:**	The system will provide Provide analytical reports and visualizations on drug consumption patterns, helping identify trends and optimize inventory management. 
## Facts
- Red cells are stored in refrigerators at 6ÂºC for up to 42 days.
- **The medical demand for blood in Bangladesh is nine lakh bags annually, and volunteer donors help meet 32% of that demand. The remaining 68% comes from relatives and friends of blood recipients, health experts say.** (The business standard)
