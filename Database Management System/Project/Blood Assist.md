**Intro:** Good morning, everyone. We are here today to present our project Blood Assist, a web based blood donation and management system.

Blood donation is a vital part of our healthcare system. It saves lives and helps patients who need blood transfusions. However, there is a constant need for blood donations. According to wikipedia, about 25% of the nation's blood supply came from voluntary donation, 20–25% from paid donors, and 50–55% from one-time donation for a specific patient. Our blood donation system will help to make it easier for people to donate blood. It will provide a centralized database of blood donors, so that hospitals and blood banks can easily find donors who match the blood types of their patients.

**Features:** 
**User registration and authentication** 
Allow users to register with the system by providing a combination of required and optional information's. The system will provide authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized individuals can access the blood bank management system.

we have incorporated a user-friendly interface that allows donors to update their information, such as contact details or any changes in their health status. This ensures that the donor database remains up to date and accurate.

**Blood Request Management** 
Our system will Provide a feature to manage blood requests from hospitals or other healthcare facilities. This should include capturing details such as the type and quantity of blood required, urgency level, and delivery information.

**Blood Donation Scheduling**
Users can schedule blood donation appointments online. Send reminders to donors about upcoming appointments and provide a calendar view for easy management.
