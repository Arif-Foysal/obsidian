We'll learn about relational database and SQL by working through the following problem ([source](https://jovian.com/outlink?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mysqltutorial.org%2Fmysql-sample-database.aspx)):

> **QUESTION**: Classic Models Inc. is a manufacturer of small scale models of cars, motorcycles, planes, ships trains etc. Products manufactured by Classic Models are sold in toy & gift stores around the world. Here's a small sample of their products ([source](https://jovian.com/outlink?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinytown.in%2F)):

Classic Models has offices around the world with dozens of employees. The customers of Classic Models are typically toy/gift stores. Each customer has a designated sales representative (an employee of Classic Models) they interact with. Customers typically place orders requesting several products in different quantities and pay for multiple orders at once via cheques.
Create a database to record and manage all of the above information. The database will also be used for day-to-day operations (adding customers, placing orders, recording payments, hiring employees etc.).![[erd-ps11.bmp]]
