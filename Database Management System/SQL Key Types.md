In SQL, keys are used to establish relationships and enforce data integrity within a database. Here are the different kinds of keys commonly used:

1. **Primary Key**: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row can be uniquely identified and helps maintain data integrity. Only one primary key is allowed per table.
    
2. **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables and is used to enforce referential integrity. It ensures that values in the foreign key column correspond to existing values in the primary key column of the referenced table.
    
3. **Unique Key**: A unique key ensures that the values in a column or a combination of columns are unique across the table. Unlike a primary key, a unique key allows NULL values, but only one NULL value is permitted. It can be used to enforce uniqueness but not as the primary identifier of a record.
    
4. **Composite Key**: A composite key is a key that consists of two or more columns. Together, these columns uniquely identify a record in a table. It is useful when a single column does not provide sufficient uniqueness.
    
5. **Candidate Key**: A candidate key is a set of columns that can uniquely identify a record in a table. It is a potential primary key before one is selected. A table may have multiple candidate keys.

These keys play crucial roles in ensuring data integrity, establishing relationships between tables, and enforcing business rules in a database.
