ALU is a fundamental component of a central processing unit (CPU) in a computer or microprocessor. The primary function of the ALU is to perform arithmetic operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and logical operations (such as AND, OR, NOT) on binary data.

The ALU takes input data from [[registers]], processes the data according to the instruction received from the control unit of the CPU, and produces the result of the operation, which is then stored back in a register or used in subsequent operations. The ALU operates on fixed-size binary data (usually 32 or 64 bits in modern processors) and is responsible for carrying out the actual computation and data manipulation in the processor.

In addition to basic arithmetic and logical operations, the ALU can also handle other operations such as bitwise shifts, comparisons (to set condition flags for branching in control flow), and more complex operations like multiplication and division. These complex operations are usually achieved through a combination of simpler ALU operations and additional circuitry within the processor.

The ALU is a critical component in the execution of instructions in a CPU, and its speed and efficiency directly impact the overall performance of the processor. In modern processors, the ALU is typically designed to operate in parallel with other units, such as floating-point units (FPU) or vector processing units, to increase overall processing speed and performance.
