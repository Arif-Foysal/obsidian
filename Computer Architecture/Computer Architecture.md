Computer Architecture refers to the structure and design principles of a computer system. It encompasses the organization, functionality and implementation of computer hardware and software that work to perform computational tasks.
## How computers executes programming languages

Computers execute programming languages through a process called [[interpretation]] or [[compilation]]. The specific method used depends on the programming language and the implementation of the language.
> It's worth noting that there are hybrid approaches as well, such as just-in-time (JIT) compilation used in languages like Java or C#. In JIT compilation, the code is initially interpreted, but frequently executed parts are dynamically compiled into machine code for improved performance.

The direct conversion of [[high level language]] to [[low level language]] is very costly. So it is much efficient to convert [[high level language]] to [[assembly-language]] and then convert it to machine language.
