SRAM is a type of RAM that stores data using flip-flop circuits, which are stable electronic circuits that can hold data as long as power is supplied.

- Operation: SRAM retains data as long as power is maintained, meaning it does not require constant refreshing like DRAM. It uses a cross-coupled inverter circuit to store each bit of data, which remains stable until changed.
- Speed: SRAM offers fast access times, making it suitable for applications that require quick data retrieval. It can perform read and write operations faster than DRAM due to its simple circuitry.
- Stability: SRAM is stable and does not require periodic refreshing to maintain data integrity. This makes it ideal for use in cache memory, where fast and reliable access to frequently accessed data is crucial.
- Complexity: SRAM is more complex and expensive to manufacture compared to DRAM due to its flip-flop circuitry, which requires more transistors per bit of data.
- Capacity: SRAM typically has lower storage density compared to DRAM, resulting in higher cost per unit of storage. However, it offers higher performance and lower power consumption.
- Usage: SRAM is commonly used in cache memory, register files, and other high-speed memory applications where fast access times and low power consumption are critical
