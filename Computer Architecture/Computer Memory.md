## Memory
There are basically two types of memory in computers.
- [[Primary Memory]]
- [[Secondary Memory]]

**CPU <--> Primary Memory <--> Secondary Memory**

Here are the key differences of primary and secondary memory-

|                   | Primary Memory (Main Memory) | Secondary Memory                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Definition        | Immediate storage directly accessible by the processor | Non-volatile storage for long-term data retention |
| Speed             | Faster data access and retrieval | Slower compared to primary memory |
| Capacity          | Relatively smaller capacity | Significantly larger capacity |
| Types             | RAM (Random Access Memory) and ROM (Read-Only Memory) | HDDs, SSDs, optical discs, magnetic tapes, external storage devices |
| Cost              | More expensive per unit of storage | Less expensive per unit of storage |
| Volatility        | Volatile (Contents are lost when power is turned off) | Non-volatile (Contents are retained even when power is turned off) |
| Persistence       | Does not retain data when power is turned off | Retains data even when power is turned off |
