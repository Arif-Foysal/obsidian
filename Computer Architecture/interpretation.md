- Interpreted Languages: In interpreted languages like [[Python]], JavaScript, or Ruby, an interpreter reads and executes the program line by line. Here's the general process:
    
    - The source code written in the programming language is passed to the interpreter.
    - The interpreter reads the code line by line, translates each line into machine-readable instructions, and executes them immediately.
    - If an error occurs, the interpreter halts the execution and reports the error, along with the line number where the error occurred.
    - This process continues until the entire program is executed or until the interpreter encounters a runtime error.
    
    In interpreted languages, each line of code is typically translated into machine instructions at runtime, which can make them slower compared to compiled languages. However, interpreted languages offer advantages like easier debugging and flexibility.
