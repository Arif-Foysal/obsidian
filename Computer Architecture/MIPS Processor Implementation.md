#Computer-Architecture #MIPS #Processor

There are 3 main approaches used in CPU designs to execute instructions. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, impacting factors like performance, complexity, and area efficiency.

1. [[single cycle architecture]] (Good)
2. [[Multi Cycle Architecture]] (Better)
4. [[Pipelining]] (Best)

# Stages of Instruction Execution
The entire instruction execution process is divided into five stages:
1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**:
	- Fetch the instruction from memory into the instruction register (IR).
	- The program counter (PC) holds the memory address of the current instruction.
	- The PC value is sent to the instruction memory (IMEM) to retrieve the instruction at that address.
	- The fetched instruction is stored in an instruction register (IR) for decoding in the next stage.
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**:
	- Decode the instruction to determine the operation and operands.
	- The control unit extracts the opcode and other necessary fields from the instruction.
	- The register file is accessed to read the values of the required source registers (if any) based on the instruction operands.
3.  **Execute (EXE)**:
	- Perform the required arithmetic or logical operation.
	- The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) performs arithmetic or logical operations based on the decoded instruction and operands obtained from the previous stage.
	- For arithmetic instructions, the ALU calculates the result.
	- For logical and branch instructions, the ALU evaluates the condition for branching.
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**:
	- Load or store data to/from memory (optional if not required by the instruction).
	- For load (LW) instructions, the memory access stage retrieves data from memory and places it in a designated register.
	- For store (SW) instructions, data from a register is written into memory.
5. **Write Back (WB)**:
	- Write the result back to the register file.
	- The result generated by the ALU in the execute stage or the data read from memory in the memory access stage is written back to the destination register specified by the instruction.
