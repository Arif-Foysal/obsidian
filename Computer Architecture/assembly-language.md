The output of the compilation process is usually assembly language code. Assembly language is a low-level human-readable representation of machine code. It uses mnemonic instructions representing the machine instructions of a specific processor architecture.
Assembly language is also called Mid Level Language.

There are several assembly languages used for **various processor architectures**. Here are some notable ones:
1. **[[MIPS]] Assembly Language/8086:** MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) assembly language is used for processors based on the MIPS architecture. It has been widely used in [[Embedded Systems]], gaming consoles, and educational settings.
2. **ARM Assembly Language:** ARM assembly language is used for processors based on the ARM architecture, which is prevalent in mobile devices, embedded systems, and other low-power applications. It supports different instruction sets like ARMv6, ARMv7, and ARMv8.
3. **x86 Assembly Language:** x86 assembly language is used for Intel and AMD x86 processors, which are widely used in personal computers and servers. It has various flavors, including Intel syntax and AT&T syntax, and supports different instruction sets such as x86-16 (16-bit), x86-32 (32-bit), and x86-64 (64-bit).
