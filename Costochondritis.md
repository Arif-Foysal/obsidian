**Costochondritis** is a benign condition that causesÂ ==chest pain and tenderness due to inflammation of the [[cartilage]] connecting the ribs to the breastbone==
## Symptoms

- Sharp pain in the chest or in the back, typically near the brestbone.
- Pain worsens with deep breathing, coughing or physical activity.
- Pain that may radiate to the back or abdomen.
- Tenderness or sensitivity when pressing on the affected rib joints.

## Causes
The cause of costochondritis is unclear, but it can result from chest injuries, repetitive movements, or underlying conditions like [[fibromyalgia]].

[[Cannabis]] can cause an elevated [[heart rate]] or [[anxiety]], both of which might make a person more aware of chest discomfort. This could amplify pain associated with **costochondritis** or make existing chest pain more noticeable.

## How to prevent costochondritis

- Take more vitamin D.
- Regular stretching.
