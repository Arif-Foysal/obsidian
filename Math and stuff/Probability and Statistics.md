## What is statistics
Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation,and presentation of data.
Data are individual facts or items of information, may be qualitative or quantitative.
## Primary and Secondary Data
==Primary data are the original data derived from your research endeavors. Secondary data are data derived from your primary data.== Primary data is information collected through original or first-hand research. For example, surveys and focus group discussions. On the other hand, secondary data is information which has been collected in the past by someone else. For
example, researching the internet, newspaper articles and company reports.
## Sample and Population
### Population
A population consists of all the items or individuals or subjects about which you
want to draw a conclusion. So, the population is the “large group” in which you are interested.
### Sample 
A sample is the portion of a population selected for analysis. The sample is the “small group” for whom we have (or plan to have) data, often randomly selected.
## Sample and Parameter
Parameter is a numerical measure that describes a characteristic of a population. Statistic is a numerical measure that describes a characteristic of a sample
## Branches of Statistics
### Descriptive Statistics: 
The branch of statistics that focuses on collecting, summarizing, and presenting a set of data.
### Inferential Statistics
The branch of statistics that analyzes sample data to draw conclusions
about a population.

## Variable
A characteristic of an individual that will be analyzed using statistics.
### Categorical Variables
have values that can only be placed into ==categories==, such as
“yes” and “no”; major; architectural style; etc.
### Numerical Variables
variables have values that represent ==quantities==.
> - ==Discrete Variables== arise from a counting process
Examples: Number of printing errors per page on a book. Number of customers arriving at a
restaurant
> - ==Continuous variables== (Can be fractional) arise from a measuring process
Examples: Height of a person, Weight of a person, Time a customer waits in a bank queue.
