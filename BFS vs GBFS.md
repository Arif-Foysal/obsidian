Breadth-First Search (BFS) explores the search space level by level, considering all nodes at a given depth before moving to nodes at the next depth level. BFS guarantees that it will find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges, but it does not use any heuristic information.

Greedy Breadth-First Search combines these two approaches by using the heuristic function to prioritize node exploration but ensuring that the search is performed in a breadth-first manner. At each step, the algorithm selects the node that has the lowest heuristic value and explores all its neighbors (children) before moving to the next level of the search space.
