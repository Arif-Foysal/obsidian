# What is a microprocessor

A **microprocessor** is a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") [processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_(computing) "Processor (computing)") where the data processing logic and control is included on a single [integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit") (IC), or a small number of ICs. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") (CPU). The IC is capable of interpreting and executing program instructions and performing arithmetic operations.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microprocessor#cite_note-1) The microprocessor is a multipurpose, [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_signal "Clock signal")-driven, [register](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register "Processor register")-based, [digital integrated circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_integrated_circuit "Digital integrated circuit") that accepts [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code "Binary code") data as input, processes it according to [instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_(computing) "Instruction (computing)") stored in its [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory "Computer memory"), and provides results (also in binary form) as output. Microprocessors contain both [combinational logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinational_logic "Combinational logic") and [sequential digital logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_logic "Sequential logic"), and operate on numbers and symbols represented in the [binary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number "Binary number") system.
