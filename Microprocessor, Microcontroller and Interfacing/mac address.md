A MAC address, or Media Access Control address, is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network address in communications within a network segment. This use is common in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth.

MAC addresses are typically written as a sequence of six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by colons, hyphens, or without a separator. For example, 00-00-5E-00-53-AF is a valid MAC address.

MAC addresses are assigned by device manufacturers, and are therefore often referred to as the burned-in address, or as an Ethernet hardware address, hardware address, or physical address.

MAC addresses are used at the data link layer of the OSI model to identify devices on a local network. When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it broadcasts a data frame with the destination device's MAC address in the header. The destination device then responds to the data frame.

MAC addresses can also be used to filter network traffic. For example, a router can be configured to only allow devices with certain MAC addresses to access the internet.

Here are some examples of how MAC addresses are used:

- To connect to a Wi-Fi network, your device needs to know the MAC address of the Wi-Fi router.
- When you send a file to another computer on the same network, the MAC addresses of both computers are used to ensure that the file is delivered correctly.
- Network administrators can use MAC addresses to troubleshoot network problems and to control access to the network.
