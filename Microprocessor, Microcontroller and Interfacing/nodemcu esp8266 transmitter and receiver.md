# The espnow protocol
espnow is a connectionless communication protocol developed by Espressif that features short packet transmission. This protocol enables multiple devices to talk to each other without using Wi-Fi. This is a fast communication protocol that can be used to exchange small messages (up to 250 bytes) between ESP32 boards. ESP-NOW is very versatile and you can have one-way or two-way communication in different arrangements.
