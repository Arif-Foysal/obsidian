A Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) is a type of computer architecture that emphasizes simplicity and efficiency in the design of the instruction set. The term "reduced" in RISC refers to the reduced complexity of the instructions compared to [[Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC)]], which have more complex and specialized instructions.

Here are some key characteristics of RISC architectures:

1. Simple Instructions: RISC architectures typically have a small and uniform set of instructions. Each instruction performs a simple and well-defined operation, often executing in a single clock cycle. RISC instructions often operate only on data in registers, with separate load and store instructions for accessing memory.

2. Load-Store Architecture: RISC architectures follow a load-store memory model, where data is explicitly loaded from memory into registers before performing arithmetic or logical operations. Results are then stored back into memory if needed. This design reduces memory access and simplifies instruction decoding.

3. Register-Based: RISC architectures have a large number of general-purpose registers, which are used to hold data and intermediate results during program execution. Register-based operations are faster than memory-based operations, leading to improved performance.

4. [[Pipelining]]: RISC architectures are well-suited for pipelining, a technique that allows multiple instructions to be executed simultaneously in different stages of the processor pipeline. RISC instructions are designed to be executed efficiently in a pipelined fashion, improving overall performance.

5. Compiler-Friendly: RISC architectures are designed to be compiler-friendly, meaning they can be efficiently translated from high-level programming languages into machine code. The simplicity of the instruction set makes it easier for compilers to optimize code and exploit parallelism.

6. Reduced Hardware Complexity: RISC architectures often have simpler hardware implementations compared to CISC architectures. The reduced complexity allows for smaller and more power-efficient processors, making RISC architectures suitable for embedded systems and mobile devices.

Some well-known RISC architectures include ARM, [[MIPS]], PowerPC, and RISC-V. These architectures have been widely used in a variety of applications, including mobile devices, embedded systems, networking equipment, and supercomputers, due to their efficiency, performance, and ease of design.
