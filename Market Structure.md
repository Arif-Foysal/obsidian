Market structure refers to the characteristics of a market that significantly affect how buyers and sellers behave and interact. These characteristics include:

- Number and size of sellers and buyers
- Type of product being sold
- Conditions for entering or exiting the market
- How transparent information is in the market


## The 4 Main Types of Market Structures

### 1. Pure (Perfect) Competition

- **Many small sellers**: No single seller can affect the market
- **Identical products**: All sellers offer the same product (homogeneous)
- **Easy entry/exit**: Businesses can freely join or leave the market
- **Perfect information**: Everyone knows everything about prices and products
- **Example**: Agricultural markets for crops like wheat or corn

In perfect competition, the industry sets the price (price maker), while individual firms must accept this price (price takers).

### 2. Monopoly

- **Single seller**: The firm is the entire industry
- **Unique product**: No close substitutes available
- **Price maker**: The firm controls prices by controlling supply
- **Barriers to entry**: Other firms can't enter the market
- **Examples**: Local utility companies, patented drugs

### 3. Monopolistic Competition

- **Many firms**: Multiple sellers offering similar but not identical products
- **Differentiated products**: Products have slight differences (branding, features)
- **Some price control**: Firms face downward-sloping demand curves
- **Easy entry/exit**: New firms can enter if they see profit opportunities
- **Example**: Restaurants, clothing brands, hair salons

Firms maximize profit where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR), and in the long run, competition tends to eliminate economic profits.

### 4. Oligopoly

- **Few large firms**: A small number of dominant sellers
- **Standardized or differentiated products**: Can be either
- **Strategic behavior**: Firms must consider competitors' reactions
- **Hard to enter**: High barriers like large capital requirements
- **Examples**: Automobile industry, airlines, cell phone providers
