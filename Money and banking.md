Velocity of Money (V) The Velocity of Money measures how many times a unit of currency is used to purchase goods and services within a specific time period. It indicates the efficiency with which money circulates in the economy. Explanation: • A higher velocity means each dollar is used more frequently to facilitate transactions. • A lower velocity indicates that money is changing hands less often, potentially signaling reduced economic activity.
