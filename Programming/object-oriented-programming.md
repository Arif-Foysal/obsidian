Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes data and behaviors into reusable structures called objects.

## Concepts of Object Oriented Programming

### Classes
A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) that objects of that class will possess. For example, if we were creating a class for a car, the properties could include the make, model, and color, while the behaviors could include starting the engine, accelerating, and braking.

### Objects
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific occurrence of the class and can be created based on the class blueprint. Using the car example, an object could be a specific car, such as a "Toyota Camry" with a particular color and model.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and related functions within a class, providing access to the data only through defined methods (member functions). This helps in achieving data abstraction and data hiding, preventing direct access to the internal implementation details of the class.

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing classes. The new class, called the derived class or subclass, inherits the properties and behaviors of the existing class, called the base class or superclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse and enables the creation of specialized classes from general ones.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It allows you to use a single interface to represent different types of objects. Polymorphism is typically achieved through virtual functions and function overriding.
