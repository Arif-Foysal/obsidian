## Intro
C++ is a mid-level, general purpose, object-oriented programming(OOP) language.

### Features of c++
- [[object-oriented-programming]]
- Machine Independent
- Simple
- High-Level Language
- Popular
- Case-sensitive
- Compiler Based
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Memory Management
- Multi-threading
### C++ is used in
- [[Embedded Systems]]
- [[software engineering]]
- scientific computing
- [[game development]]
- high performance application
- [[operating systems]]
## Header Files of C++
**iostream**:Input/output stream handling (cin, cout, cerr).
**iomanip**:Input/output manipulation (setw, setprecision).
**fstream**:File stream (ifstream, ofstream).
**cstdlib**:C Standard General Utilities Library (stdlib.h).
**cmath**:C Math Library (math.h).
**cstring**:C String Handling (string.h).
**ctime**:C Time Library (time.h).
**vector**: Dynamic array implementation.
list, queue, stack, algorithm, set etc.

The Standard Template Library (STL) of C++ provides useful
codes.
STL is a set of C++ template classes to provide common
programming data structures and functions such as lists,
stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes,
algorithms, and iterators.
