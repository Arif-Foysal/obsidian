>Also known as **Production Possibility Curve(PPC).**


- A graph representing the possible **combinations of goods** an economy can produce given its resources and technology.
- Points on the PPF are **efficient**, inside are **inefficient**, and outside are **unattainable/impossible** with the given resources and technology.
- The slope represents the opportunity cost of producing one good over another.
- can be used to illustrate the concepts of scarcity, opportunity cost, efficiency, inefficiency, economic growth, and contractions.

## Shifts in the PPF

Economic growth (e.g., technological advancements or better resource utilization) can shift the PPF outward, enabling greater production.

![[Opportunity Cost]]

## Efficiency
The full employment of resources in production; efficient combinations of output will always be on the PPC.

**Inefficient use (under-utilization) of resources:** The underemployment of any of the four economic resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability); inefficient combinations of production are represented using a PPC as points on the interior of the PPC. 

## **Economic Growth:**
An increase in an economy's ability to produce goods and services over time; economic growth in the PPC model is illustrated by a shift out of the PPC. 

**Productivity:** (also called technology) the ability to combine economic resources; an increase in productivity causes economic growth even if economic resources have not changed, which would be represented by a shift out of the PPC. 

**Economic Contraction:** A decrease in output that occurs due to the under-utilization of resources; in a graphical model of the PPC, a contraction is represented by moving to a point that is further away from, and on the interior of, the PPC.


## Practice Problems
![[Pasted image 20250417174944.png]]
**Solution:**

a. Just plot
![[Pasted image 20250417180944.png]]

**b.** 
This combination is **not possible** based on the PPC. The schedule shows that if you produce **80 units of X**, the maximum Y is **60**. So 80X and 80Y is **beyond** the PPC ‚Äî meaning **resources are not sufficient** to produce that much of both.


This combination lies **inside** the PPC because at 40X, you could produce 90Y (Point B). Producing only 75Y means you are **underutilizing resources**.
**It is possible**, but ‚ùå **not rational**, because you are not producing on the efficient frontier. You could increase Y without decreasing X, or increase X without decreasing Y.
>**"rational"** means **making the best use of available resources** to get the **maximum possible benefit** or output.


![[Pasted image 20250417175005.png]]
**Solution:**
**a.**
![[scarcity#What is scarcity?]]

Scarcity is shown because the PPC **only includes limited combinations** of two goods ‚Äî meaning we can't have unlimited amounts of both. The curve exists because of scarcity ‚Äî if resources weren't limited, the PPC would be unlimited.


**b.**
Points **outside the PPC** represent **combinations that are currently impossible** to produce.

These are **unattainable** because the economy **does not have enough resources or technology** to produce that much of both goods at once.


**c.**
![[Opportunity Cost#What is Opportunity/Marginal Cost?]]


As you move from one point to another along the curve, you gain more of one good but must give up some of the other. That trade-off shows the **opportunity cost**.

**d.**
Operating **on the PPC** means the economy is using **all its resources efficiently**.

‚úÖ It shows **maximum output** is being achieved with current resources. No waste.


**e.**
**Inefficiency** is shown by points **inside the PPC**.
‚ö†Ô∏è These points mean resources are **not fully used** (e.g., unemployment, idle factories). The economy **could produce more** of one or both goods without sacrificing the other.


**f.**


**Economic growth** is shown by an **outward shift** of the PPC.

üìà Factors causing this:
- More resources (like labor or capital)
- Better education or training
- Technological advancements    
- Investment in infrastructure


**g.**

An **economic contraction** is shown by an **inward shift** of the PPC.

üìâ Causes:
- Natural disasters
- War
- Loss of resources (like depletion of raw materials)
- Economic crises (like recessions)
This means the economy can now produce **less** than before.

**h.**

**Technological advancements** improve the way goods are produced.

üîß Effects:
- The PPC **shifts outward**, allowing **more output** with the same resources.
- If the tech improves only for one good, the curve **shifts outward more** for that good, becoming **skewed**.
