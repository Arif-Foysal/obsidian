**1.**
**a.**

The opportunity cost is the number of tables that must be given up to produce each additional cupboard.
- From A to B (0 to 1 cupboard): 14 - 12 = 2 tables
- From B to C (1 to 2 cupboards): 12 - 9 = 3 tables
- From C to D (2 to 3 cupboards): 9 - 5 = 4 tables
- From D to E (3 to 4 cupboards): 5 - 0 = 5 tables


**b.**


**c.**
A point indicating unemployed resources would lie¬†_inside_¬†the production possibilities curve. This is because the company is not using all of its available resources (labor, capital, etc.) to their full potential.

**d.**

No, Pinetree Furniture Company cannot produce 8 tables and 3 cupboards during the same year, given their current production possibilities.

- **Why unattainable:**¬†The point (3 cupboards, 8 tables) lies¬†_outside_¬†the production possibilities curve. This means that with their current resources and technology, they cannot simultaneously produce that much of both goods. They are limited by their current production capacity.
- **How it could be reached:**¬†This production level could be reached in the future through:
    - **Technological advancements:**¬†New technology could allow them to produce more of both goods with the same amount of resources.
    - **Increased resources:**¬†If Pinetree Furniture Company acquired more resources (e.g., more workers, more capital), they could increase their production capacity.
    - **Improved efficiency:**¬†By improving their production processes and becoming more efficient, they could potentially produce more with the same resources.

**e. Identify and explain the economic law which is responsible for the production possibility curve having a concave (bowed out) curvature.**

Ans:
The economic law responsible for the concave shape of the production possibilities curve is the¬†**Law of Increasing Opportunity Cost.**

This law states that:

> **As the production of one good increases, the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of that good also increases.**

- **Explanation:**
	- As you move along the production possibilities curve, producing more of one good requires giving up increasingly larger amounts of the other good. This is because resources are not perfectly adaptable to the production of both goods. Some resources are better suited for making tables, while others are better suited for making cupboards. As you shift resources from their best use to another use, the opportunity cost increases. This increasing opportunity cost is what causes the bowed-out shape of the production possibilities curve.



**2. If the production of good X increases by 3 units and production of good Y decreases by one unit, then the opportunity cost of one unit of X is ____ unit(s) of Y?**

Ans:

To produce 3 more units of X, 1 unit of Y is sacrificed.

So, to produce 1 more units of X, 1/3 units of Y is sacrificed.

**3.**

**a.**
Looking at the graph, when Alison grows 80 bunches of kale (Option C), she is growing¬†**40**¬†bunches of radishes.

**b.**
- **A to B:**¬†20 radishes gained, 40 kale lost. Opportunity cost = 40 kale / 20 radishes = 2 kale per radish.
- **B to C:**¬†20 radishes gained, 40 kale lost. Opportunity cost = 40 kale / 20 radishes = 2 kale per radish.
- **C to D:**¬†20 radishes gained, 40 kale lost. Opportunity cost = 40 kale / 20 radishes = 2 kale per radish.
- **D to E:**¬†20 radishes gained, 40 kale lost. Opportunity cost = 40 kale / 20 radishes = 2 kale per radish.

**c.**
This is the inverse of the previous calculation. We can calculate it similarly, looking at how many radishes Alison gives up when she produces more kale:

- **B to A:**¬†40 kale gained, 20 radishes lost. Opportunity cost = 20 radishes / 40 kale = 0.5 radishes per kale.
- **C to B:**¬†40 kale gained, 20 radishes lost. Opportunity cost = 20 radishes / 40 kale = 0.5 radishes per kale.
- **D to C:**¬†40 kale gained, 20 radishes lost. Opportunity cost = 20 radishes / 40 kale = 0.5 radishes per kale.
- **E to D:**¬†40 kale gained, 20 radishes lost. Opportunity cost = 20 radishes / 40 kale = 0.5 radishes per kale.

Therefore, the opportunity cost of one bunch of kale is¬†**0.5 (or 1/2) bunches of radishes**.



**d.**
**Step 1: Estimate Kale Production at 30 Radishes**

30 radishes is halfway between points B (20 radishes, 120 kale) and C (40 radishes, 80 kale). Assuming a relatively smooth curve, we can estimate that at 30 radishes, kale production is approximately halfway between 120 and 80:

Kale at 30 radishes ‚âà (120 + 80) / 2 = 100 bunches

**Step 2: Estimate Kale Production at 50 Radishes**

50 radishes is halfway between points C (40 radishes, 80 kale) and D (60 radishes, 40 kale). So, we can estimate that at 50 radishes, kale production is approximately halfway between 80 and 40:

Kale at 50 radishes ‚âà (80 + 40) / 2 = 60 bunches

**Step 3: Calculate the Changes**

- Change in Radishes: 50 - 30 = 20 bunches
- Change in Kale: 60 - 100 = -40 bunches (note the negative sign, indicating a decrease)

**Step 4: Calculate the Opportunity Cost**

Opportunity Cost of Producing 20 More Radishes = (Kale Forgone) / (Radishes Gained) = |-40| / 20 = 40 / 20 = 2 bunches of kale

**Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing another 20 bunches of radishes, starting from 30 bunches, is approximately 2 bunches of kale per radish.**

**Important Note:**¬†The opportunity cost in this case is¬†_2 bunches of Kale per Radish_¬†and¬†_not_¬†40 bunches of Kale.

**Therefore, the opportunity cost of producing another 20 bunches of radishes, starting from 30 bunches, is 40 bunches of kale.**


**e. Identify and explain the economic law which is responsible for the production possibilitycurve having a concave (bowed out) curvature.**

Ans:
see, 
1. e

**f.**
Yes, the opportunity cost in this Production Possibility Frontier (PPF) is **constant**.
Here's why:
From the table:
- Moving from A to B: +20 radishes, ‚àí40 kale
- Moving from B to C: +20 radishes, ‚àí40 kale
- Moving from C to D: +20 radishes, ‚àí40 kale
- Moving from D to E: +20 radishes, ‚àí40 kale
Each time the farm produces 20 more bunches of radishes, it gives up 40 bunches of kale. That‚Äôs a constant rate of trade-off.
### Opportunity Cost (in terms of kale):
Opportunity¬†Cost¬†of¬†1¬†bunch¬†of¬†radishes=40/20 = 2 bunches of kale


**4.**  Points on the production possibility frontier represents: 
A. Total efficiency 
B. Allocative efficiency 
C. An unattainable combination of goods 
D. Productive efficiency (Ans) 
E. Underemployment of resources


- **Points on the PPF** represent combinations of goods (in this case, radishes and kale) that can be produced when all resources are **fully and efficiently used**.
    
- This means the economy is **productively efficient**‚Äîit's getting the maximum output from its resources.


**5.**
Identify whether the following items are factors of production. If yes, identify which type of factor theyare (land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship): 
a) Oil from the Alberta tar sands 
b) A bottle of perfume 
c) A dump truck 
d) The knowledge to design web sites 
e) Coal 
f) The ability to hammer nails 
g) A drill for wells 
h) Contracting business to build homes 
i) An umbrella

**Ans:**

Let's go through each item and identify whether it is a **factor of production**, and if yes, which type: **Land**, **Labour**, **Capital**, or **Entrepreneurship**.

|Item|Factor of Production?|Type|
|---|---|---|
|a) Oil from the Alberta tar sands|Yes|**Land** (natural resource)|
|b) A bottle of perfume|**No**|It's a finished **good**, not a factor itself|
|c) A dump truck|Yes|**Capital** (man-made tool used in production)|
|d) The knowledge to design websites|Yes|**Labour** (specifically, **human capital**)|
|e) Coal|Yes|**Land** (natural resource)|
|f) The ability to hammer nails|Yes|**Labour** (a physical skill)|
|g) A drill for wells|Yes|**Capital** (tool used in production)|
|h) Contracting business to build homes|Yes|**Entrepreneurship** (organizing land, labour, and capital)|
|i) An umbrella|**No**|It's a **final product**, not used in producing other goods|


**6. Country X‚Äôs economy produces more capital goods and fewer consumer goods than country Y‚Äôs economy. Which country‚Äôs economy will experinece more rapid growth? Draw two production possibilities curves demonstrating your answer.**

Ans:

Country X, which produces more capital goods and fewer consumer goods than Country Y, is likely to experience more rapid economic growth in the long run. Here‚Äôs why:

- **Capital Goods and Future Production:**¬†Capital goods (e.g., machinery, factories, equipment) are used to produce other goods and services in the future. By investing more in capital goods, Country X is essentially expanding its future productive capacity.
- **Consumer Goods and Current Consumption:**¬†Consumer goods (e.g., food, clothing, entertainment) satisfy immediate wants and needs. While they are essential for current living standards, they don‚Äôt directly contribute to expanding future production.
- **Economic Growth:**¬†Economic growth is the increase in the production of goods and services over time. By prioritizing capital goods, Country X is sacrificing some current consumption to invest in its future ability to produce. This leads to a higher rate of economic growth.
Let‚Äôs create two simplified schedules for Country X and Country Y.

üè≠ **Country X: More Capital Goods**

| Combination | Capital Goods | Consumer Goods |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| A           | 90            | 10             |
| B           | 80            | 20             |
| C           | 70            | 30             |
| D           | 60            | 40             |
| E           | 50            | 50             |

üõí **Country Y: More Consumer Goods**

|Combination|Capital Goods|Consumer Goods|
|---|---|---|
|A|50|50|
|B|40|60|
|C|30|70|
|D|20|80|
|E|10|90|

- **Country X** is allocating **more resources to capital goods**, which will increase its **productive capacity** in the future.
- **Country Y** is focusing on **current consumption**, so its economy may grow slower over time.
- Over the long term, Country X‚Äôs PPF will **shift outward faster**, reflecting **higher economic growth**.

**7. If a production possibilities curve between DVD players and mp3 players exists, how does a technological advance that increases the efficiency of mp3 player production affect the PPF?**

Ans:

A **technological advance** that increases the **efficiency of MP3 player production** will affect the **Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)** in the following way:

### üîß **Effect on the PPF:**

- The **PPF will rotate outward**, but **only along the MP3 player axis**.    
- This means the **maximum possible production of MP3 players increases**, while the production capacity for DVD players stays the same (since the technology only affects MP3 production).
- The economy can now produce **more MP3 players** for any given number of DVD players.

**8. Which of the following event‚Äôs is least likely to shift a society's PPF outward? 
a. Discovery of natural gas 
b. Training for workers that increases the amount of a good that can be produced per worker 
c. A shift in preference for one good compared to the other good 
d. Invention of a new process of production that reduces the resources necessary to produce a good**


Ans:

|Option|Effect on PPF|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|a|Shifts outward|More resources (natural gas)|
|b|Shifts outward|Higher worker productivity|
|c|‚ùå No shift|Only changes allocation, not capacity|
|d|Shifts outward|Technological improvement|


## Problem Set 2

[[Equilibrium Analysis]]

1. The following equations represent supply and demand for cafeteria meals at a university: 
		o Qs = 25 + 3P 
		o Qd = 120 ‚Äì 3P 
	a. Find the amount of demand and supply for prices: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. 
	b. Plot the supply and demand curves using the values in the table. 
	c. Determine the equilibrium price and quantity.


**a.**

| **Price (P)** | **Qd = 120 ‚Äì 3P**   | **Qs = 25 + 3P** |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0             | 120                 | 25               |
| 10            | 90                  | 55               |
| 20            | 60                  | 85               |
| 30            | 30                  | 115              |
| 40            | 0                   | 145              |
| 50            | -30 (not realistic) | 175              |

**b.**

![[Pasted image 20250418000518.png]]


**c.**

At equilibrium,
	`Qs = Qd`

So,

	25 + 3P  = 120 ‚Äì 3P 
=> 6P = 95
=> P = 15.83 (eq. price)

**eq. quantity:**

Q = 25+ 3(15.83) = 72.5



2. **Differentiate between Absolute Advantage and Comparative Advantage with examples. Which one matters more in trade and why?**

**Ans:**

| Feature                              | **Absolute Advantage**                                     | **Comparative Advantage**                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**                       | Ability to produce more of a good using the same resources | Ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost                                                  |
| **Focus**                            | Productivity                                               | Opportunity cost                                                                                       |
| **Basis for Trade**                  | Not the main reason for trade                              | **Primary reason** countries trade                                                                     |
| **Possible to have for both goods?** | Yes                                                        | **No**, a country will always have a comparative advantage in **one** good if opportunity costs differ |

### üåç **Which One Matters More in Trade?**

#### ‚úÖ **Comparative Advantage matters more.**

#### üìà **Why?**
- Trade allows each country to **specialize** in producing goods where they have **lower opportunity costs**, even if they are less efficient overall.
- This leads to **greater total production and mutual gains**.
- Countries (or individuals) benefit by focusing on what they do **relatively better**, not absolutely better.


**Graphical Interpretation and Analysis**

**a.**

![[Pasted image 20250418004719.png]]


**b.**

**Price = 1**
- Demand = 90
- Supply = 25
- **Demand > Supply** ‚Üí **Shortage**
    - **Shortage = 90 - 25 = 65 units**
**Price = 4**
- Demand = 30
- Supply = 100
- **Supply > Demand** ‚Üí **Surplus**
    - **Surplus = 100 - 30 = 70 units**



## üìò **Example Problem: Tax on Suppliers**

Suppose the market for bottled water is represented by the following equations:
- **Demand:** Qd=100‚àí5PQ_d = 100 - 5PQd‚Äã=100‚àí5P
- **Supply:** Qs=10+5PQ_s = 10 + 5PQs‚Äã=10+5P

Now the government imposes a **Taka 4 per unit tax on suppliers**.
