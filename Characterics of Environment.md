1. Fully or Partially Observable: 
	- Fully observable: If the agent has access to complete information about the state of the environment at any given time, it is considered a fully observable environment. For example, a chessboard game where the agent can see the positions of all pieces and the entire board.
	- Partially observable: If the agent has limited or incomplete information about the state of the environment, it is a partially observable environment. For example, in a poker game, the agent can only see its own cards and some common cards, but not the opponents' cards.
2. Single or Multi-agent: 
	- Single-agent: If there is only one agent operating in the environment, it is a single-agent environment. For example, a robot vacuum cleaner cleaning a room by itself without any other robot interference.
	 - Multi-agent: If there are multiple agents interacting in the environment, it is a multi-agent environment. For example, a soccer game with two teams, where each team has multiple players competing against each other.
3. Deterministic or Stochastic: 
	- Deterministic: In a deterministic environment, the next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the actions taken by the agent. There is no randomness involved. For example, a game of tic-tac-toe, where the outcome of each move is determined by the players' actions.
	- Stochastic: In a stochastic environment, there is an element of randomness or uncertainty involved in the outcome of an action. The next state is not entirely predictable. For example, in a weather prediction system, the weather conditions can change due to various unpredictable factors like wind patterns or atmospheric disturbances.
4. Episodic or Sequential: 
	- Episodic: In an episodic environment, the agent's actions and decisions are independent of previous episodes or interactions with the environment. Each episode is self-contained and does not affect future episodes. For example, playing a single hand of poker or solving individual math problems.
	- Sequential: In a sequential environment, the agent's actions and decisions depend on the history of previous interactions with the environment. The current state and future actions are influenced by the sequence of past actions and observations. For example, driving a car in traffic, where the current traffic conditions and the agent's past movements affect future decision-making.
5. Static or Dynamic:
	- Static Environment: In a static environment, the external factors and conditions do not change while the agent is performing its tasks. The state of the environment remains constant throughout the agent's operation. In other words, there are no changes in the environment that could affect the agent's decision-making process. For example, Sorting a list of numbers: The list of numbers to be sorted remains constant while sorting.
	- Dynamic Environment: In a dynamic environment, the external factors and conditions can change while the agent is performing its tasks. The state of the environment can evolve over time, presenting new challenges and requiring the agent to adapt and respond to these changes. For example, Weather forecasting: The environment is dynamic as weather conditions are constantly changing. The agent, in this case, a weather prediction system, needs to analyze incoming data and update its predictions to account for evolving weather patterns.
6. Discrete vs Continuous: 
	- Discrete: In a [[discrete]] environment, the possible states, actions, or values are finite and often integer-based. The transitions between these states or values are typically well-defined and can be represented in a discrete manner. For example, A board game like chess or checkers, where the positions, moves, and outcomes are discrete and limited to specific positions or actions on the board.
	- Continuous: Continuous refers to variables or characteristics that can take on an infinite number of values within a specific range. Continuous environment is the environments where the possible states of the agents are not countable. For example, self driving car: where infinite number of states is possible because of random objects and situations of the environment.
