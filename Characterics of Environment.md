1. Fully or Partially Observable: 
	- Fully observable: If the agent has access to complete information about the state of the environment at any given time, it is considered a fully observable environment. For example, a chessboard game where the agent can see the positions of all pieces and the entire board.
	- Partially observable: If the agent has limited or incomplete information about the state of the environment, it is a partially observable environment. For example, in a poker game, the agent can only see its own cards and some common cards, but not the opponents' cards.
2. Single or Multi-agent: 
	- Single-agent: If there is only one agent operating in the environment, it is a single-agent environment. For example, a robot vacuum cleaner cleaning a room by itself without any other robot interference.
	 - Multi-agent: If there are multiple agents interacting in the environment, it is a multi-agent environment. For example, a soccer game with two teams, where each team has multiple players competing against each other.
3. Deterministic or Stochastic: 
	- Deterministic: In a deterministic environment, the next state of the environment is completely determined by the current state and the actions taken by the agent. There is no randomness involved. For example, a game of tic-tac-toe, where the outcome of each move is determined by the players' actions.
	- Stochastic: In a stochastic environment, there is an element of randomness or uncertainty involved in the outcome of an action. The next state is not entirely predictable. For example, in a weather prediction system, the weather conditions can change due to various unpredictable factors like wind patterns or atmospheric disturbances.
4. Episodic or Sequential: 
	- Episodic: In an episodic environment, the agent's actions and decisions are independent of previous episodes or interactions with the environment. Each episode is self-contained and does not affect future episodes. For example, playing a single hand of poker or solving individual math problems.
	- Sequential: In a sequential environment, the agent's actions and decisions depend on the history of previous interactions with the environment. The current state and future actions are influenced by the sequence of past actions and observations. For example, driving a car in traffic, where the current traffic conditions and the agent's past movements affect future decision-making.
