- [[JS For loop]] - loops through a block of code a number of times
- [[JS For in loop]] - loops through the properties of an object
- [[JS For of loop]] - loops through the values of an iterable object 
- [[JS while loop]] - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
- [[JS while loop]] - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
