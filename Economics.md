## What is economics?
Economics is the study of **how society manages its [[scarcity|scarce]] resources**.

Economists analyze **decision-making**, **interactions**, and **forces affecting the economy**.

## 10 Principles of economics
#### **How People Make Decisions**

- **People Face Trade-offs**
    
    - Every choice comes with a cost. If a government spends more on **defense ("guns")**, it has fewer resources for **social welfare ("butter")**. Individuals also face trade-offs, like choosing between **work** (income) and **leisure** (free time).
- **The Cost of Something Is What You Give Up to Get It**
    
    - This is known as **opportunity cost**. For example, attending college means you **give up** earning a full-time salary during those years. The true cost isn’t just tuition but also lost income and experience.
- **Rational People Think at the Margin**
    
    - Rather than making all-or-nothing choices, rational people consider **small incremental changes** (marginal decisions). For instance, a student decides whether to study **one extra hour** rather than whether to study all day.
- **People Respond to Incentives**
    
    - Decisions are influenced by **rewards and punishments**. For example, higher fuel prices encourage people to **drive less** or buy **fuel-efficient cars**, while tax cuts may motivate businesses to **hire more workers**.


#### **How People Interact**

5. **Trade Can Make Everyone Better Off**
6. **Markets Are Usually a Good Way to Organize Economic Activity**
7. **Governments Can Sometimes Improve Market Outcomes** 

#### **How the Economy as a Whole Works**

8. **A Country’s Standard of Living Depends on Its Ability to Produce Goods and Services** – Productivity drives prosperity.
9. **Prices Rise When the Government Prints Too Much Money** – Excess money supply causes **inflation**.
10. **Society Faces a Short-Run Trade-off between Inflation and Unemployment** – Policies impact inflation and job availability.


## Microeconomics
Microeconomics studies individual decision-making by households and firms in markets.

## Macroeconomics
Macroeconomics examines broader economic phenomena like unemployment, government borrowing, and national growth.

- Firms produce goods/services using factors of production (labor, land, and capital), which are owned by households.
