## Practice Problems

### Theoretical
1. Explain why an economy’s income must equal its expenditure. 
2. Which contributes more to GDP—the production of an economy car or the production of a luxury car? Why? 
3. A farmer sells wheat to a baker for $2. The baker uses the wheat to make bread, which is sold for $3. What is the total contribution of these transactions to GDP? 
4. Many years ago, Peggy paid $500 to put together a record collection. Today, she sold her albums at a garage sale for $100. How does this sale affect current GDP? 
5. List the four components of GDP. Give an example of each. 
6. Why do economists use real GDP rather than nominal GDP to gauge economic well-being? 
7. In the year 2017, the economy produces 100 loaves of bread that sell for $2 each. In the year 2018, the economy produces 200 loaves of bread that sell for $3 each. Calculate nominal GDP, real GDP, and the GDP deflator for each year. (Use 2017 as the base year.) By what percentage does each of these three statistics rise from one year to the next? 
8. Why is it desirable for a country to have a large GDP? Give an example of something that would raise GDP and yet be undesirable.

**2.**
a. True or false: nominal GDP is always larger than real GDP.
- **Answer:** False.  
    Nominal GDP can be larger or smaller than real GDP depending on the price level. If prices fall (deflation), nominal GDP can be less than real GDP.

b. True or false: real GDP is always larger than real GDP per capita.
- **Answer:** True.  
    Real GDP is the total output, while real GDP per capita is the output per person, so real GDP is always larger.

**Intermediate goods** are used to produce other goods (e.g., steel for cars).  
**Final goods and services** are bought by end consumers (e.g., a car).
**Intermediate goods are excluded from GDP** to avoid double counting since their value is included in the final goods.

3. Suppose the last year consumer price index was 1.20. If the inflation rate is 4%, then find out the consumer price index of the current year.

- **Real GDP** adjusts for changes in price level (inflation or deflation), reflecting the true growth in output.
- **Nominal GDP** can increase due to price changes, not actual production growth.
- Therefore, real GDP gives a more accurate measure of economic well-being over time.
