- Economic concept proposed by economist Adam Smith and further developed by economist William Stanley Jevons. 
- It refers to the observation that despite water being essential for life, it is generally less valuable in economic terms than diamonds, which have limited utility. 
- The paradox arises from the fact that the value of a good is determined not solely by its usefulness but also by its scarcity and marginal utility. 
- Water, being abundant and necessary for survival, has a low marginal utility and thus a low price. 
- Diamonds, on the other hand, are rare, aesthetically pleasing, and not essential for survival, leading to high marginal utility and a higher price. 
- The paradox highlights that value in economics is not solely determined by necessity but also by relative scarcity and subjective preferences.
