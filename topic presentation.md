**intro**
Today, we are excited to present our project idea on "Hospital Management System."
- My name is [Name], and I'll be giving you an overview of our project and its objectives.

**objectives**
The main objective of our project is to develop a comprehensive hospital management system that enhances patient care.
We aim to create a centralized platform that integrates various departments, increasing efficiency and to reduce costs.

**Languages and technologies used**
We will be using HTML and CSS for the front end, as we are building a web application. We will use PHP for the back end, and of course, MYSQL for managing the database.

**Users**
In our system, there will be 3 different types of users, each with unique privileges- Patients, Doctors, Nurses and other staff members. 

**Features for the patients**
**Registration**: Patients can register by providing their demographic information, medical history and insurance details.
Here some of the fields are optional such as: occupation, marital status etc. And the required fields include: Blood group, Emergency Contact, allergies etc.

**Online Appointment Scheduling**
Enable patients to schedule appointments with doctors based on their availability, view available time slots, and receive appointment reminders.

**Medical Record Access**
Patients will have read-only access to their own medical records, including diagnoses, prescriptions, test results, and treatment plans.
Patients will have read and write access to their own demographic information, medical history, contact details, and insurance information stored in the patient information table.

**Prescription Renewal**
Patients can request prescription renewals, without the need for in-person visits.

Thank you. Now our next team member will dive into the next part.
