**Dynamic Programming** is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems. By solving each sub-problem **only once** and **storing the results**, it avoids redundant computations, leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.

For example, if we write simple recursive solution for [[fibonacci series using recursion]], we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it by storing solutions of sub-problems, time complexity reduces to linear.
