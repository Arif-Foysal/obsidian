**Key Idea**

- A linear-sequential life cycle model
- Each phase must be completed before the next phase begins.
- There is no overlapping in the phases.  
    **Advantages**
- Simple and easy way to understand.
- Clearly defined stages.
- Easy to arrange tasks.
- Nice documentation is possible.
- Good for small scale projects.  
    **Disadvantages**
- Very rigid structure and thus slow
- No working software is produced until the end.
- Cannot accommodate changing requirements.
- It is difficult to measure progress within stages.
- Not a good model for complex or large scale projects.
- High amounts of risk and uncertainity.

**When to choose waterfall?**  
Use waterfall only when you have a project with clearly defined scope. It is not suitable for development  
that involves many unknowns. Waterfall is ideal for projects with predictable outcomes and when you have a team of inexperienced developers.

Agile methodology takes a different approach from the conventional, linear method.

Agile focuses on howto satisfy the users instead of emphasizing documentation and rigid procedures.

With Agile,

- tasks are broken into short sprints that take about 1 to 4 weeks to complete.
- Itâ€™s an iterative model that involves multiple tests as the development progresses.
- Developers continuously seek feedback from customers and make changes to the software.

**Advantages**

- Software has minimal defects due to the iterative effort in testing and fine-tuning.
- Clarity between team members during development, thanks to the frequent and transparent development.
- Changes in project requirements are easily addressed and work on with little impact on the timeline.
- An overall improvement on the deliverableâ€™s quality.

**Disadvantages**

- The team can sometimes lose focus due to overwhelming change requests.
- Documentation takes a back seat in Agile, which can be a problem later on in development.
- Agile focuses on discussions and feedback, which can be too time-consuming for the team.
- Due to its non-structured approach, Agile requires experienced developers who can work independently.

**When to choose Agile methodology**  
The Agile methodology is ideal for projects with fast-changing requirements. If youâ€™re building software in a new niche, youâ€™ll want to use Agile. It works best to  
implement the additional ideas as you learn more about the market needs. Of course, this assumes that your team of developers is highly independent and comfortable working in a fast-paced, non structured environment.

## Prototype Methodology

Prototype Methodology

Instead of developing a full-fledged software, the prototype model allows developers to work on the prototype version of the final product. The prototype is then made available for customer testing, evaluation, and feedback.

Based on the gathered feedback, the prototype goes through several iterations of refinement until itâ€™s deemed satisfactory by the customer. The appeal of the prototype approach is its rigorous evaluation that uncovers possible issues before actual development begins.

**Advantages**

- Good in ironing out potential issues in the early development stage, which greatly reduces product failure risk.
- Ensures the customer is happy with the â€˜productâ€™, before real development started.
- Build rapport with the customer early on with the discussions, which helps throughout the project.
- Gather detailed information with the prototype, which is later on used in building the final version.

**Disadvantages**

- Excessive to and from in testing out the prototype with the customer can delay the development timeline.
- The customerâ€™s expectations of the actual product may not align with the prototype.
- Thereâ€™s a risk of cost overrun as the works on the prototype are often paid for by the developer.  
    **When to use prototype methodology**  
    The prototype model is ideal when youâ€™re building software with many unknowns. For example, an online platform with intense user interaction. With the prototype model, you can find out what works best with users and reduce the risk of developing the actual product.

## Scrum Methodology

Scrum Methodology

Scrum is arguably one of the most flexible software development  
methodologies available. It is based on the Agile philosophy and is favored for its incremental and iterative approaches. The Scrum methodology involves the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team.

The product owner takes input from the client and ensures that the team is on track in fulfilling the clientâ€™s requirements. Meanwhile, the Scrum Master acts as a facilitator and ensures that team members are familiar with the Scrum process. The team takes charge of executing the development.

What makes Scrum an ideal methodology in a fast-paced environment is how tasks are executed in sprints. Each sprint takes up to 4 weeks. The speedy execution allows teams to identify issues, introduce solutions, test, and gather feedback in a short period. It makes tackling fast-paced projectsmuch easier.

**Advantages**

- Short iterations allow quick resolutions to problems.
- Scrum is very responsive to changes as the process includes regular feedback.
- Scrum is economical and effective.
- Regular meetings ensure that team members are on the same page at all times.
- Contributions of individual members are noticed and appreciated through the Scrum meetings.  
    **Disadvantages**
- All team members must be equally skilled and committed for Scrum to work.
- The daily Scrum meetings can be draining for team members.
- May increase time-to-market if thereâ€™s no strict control on the deadline.
- Not suitable for large projects.  
    **When to use scrum methodology**  
    Scum is the go-to methodology if you have a project with vague requirements but needs to adapt to frequent changes. For example, you need to get an MVP built quickly and test it out amongst users. Remember that Scrum is only effective if you have a fully- committed and experienced team.

## Extreme Programming Methodology

Extreem programming Methodology

Extreme programming, or XP, focuses on frequent releases of software versions within short time frames, allowing the developers to incorporate new requirements as needed with each version.

This methodology relies on regular feedback and open communication with the client to establish these  
requirements. XP helps ensure all the members of the development team are aware of the project goals and can align their efforts.  
**Advantages**

- The main advantage of Extreme  
    Programming is that this methodology  
    allows software development companies  
    to save costs and time required for project  
    realization. Time savings are available  
    because of the fact that XP focuses on the  
    timely delivery of final products. Extreme  
    Programming teams save lots of money  
    because they donâ€™t use too much  
    documentation. They usually solve  
    problems through discussions inside of the  
    team.
    
- Simplicity is one more advantage of  
    Extreme Programming projects. The  
    developers who prefer to use this  
    methodology create extremely simple code  
    that can be improved at any moment.
    
- The whole process in XP is visible and  
    accountable.
    
- Constant feedback is also the strong side.
    
- XP assists to create software faster thanks to the regular testing at the development stage.
    

**Disadvantages**  
ðŸš«Some specialists say that Extreme  
Programming is focused on the code rather  
than on design. That may be a problem  
because good design is extremely  
important for software applications. It  
helps sell them in the software market.  
Additionally, in XP projects the defect  
documentation is not always good. Lack of  
defect documentation may lead to the  
occurrence of similar bugs in the future.

**When to use Extreme Programming**

- Expect their systemâ€™s functionality to change every few months.
- Experience constantly changing requirements or work with customers who arenâ€™t sure what they want the system to do.
- Want to mitigate project risk, especially around tight deadlines.
- Are able to work closely with customers.

## Bohem's Spiral Methodology

Bohem's Spiral Methodology

The spiral model, initially proposed  
by Boehm, is an evolutionary  
software process model that  
couples the iterative feature of  
prototyping with the controlled and  
systematic aspects of the linear  
sequential model. It implements the  
potential for rapid development of  
new versions of the software.

Using the spiral model, the software  
is developed in a series of  
incremental releases. During the  
early iterations, the additional  
release may be a paper model or  
prototype. During later iterations,  
more and more complete versions  
of the engineered system are  
produced.

**Advantages**

- High amount of risk analysis
- Useful for large and mission-critical projects.  
    **Disadvantages**
- Can be a costly model to use.
- Risk analysis needed highly particular expertise
- Doesn't work well for smaller projects.

**When to choose Bohem's Spiral Methodology**

- When deliverance is required to be frequent.
- When the project is large
- When requirements are unclear and complex
- When changes may require at any time
- Large and high budget projects

## Incremental Software Development Methodology

Incremental Software Development Methodology

Incremental Model is a process of  
software development where  
requirements are broken down into  
multiple standalone modules of  
software development cycle.  
Incremental development is done in  
steps from analysis design,

implementation,

testing/verification, maintenance.

Each iteration passes through the  
requirements, design, coding and  
testing phases. And each  
subsequent release of the system  
adds function to the previous  
release until all designed  
functionality has been  
implemented.

- System development is broken  
    down into many mini  
    development projects
- Partial systems are successively  
    built to produce a final total  
    system
- Highest priority requirement is  
    tackled first
- Once the requirement is  
    developed, requirement for that  
    increment are frozen

**Advantages**  
The software will be generated quickly  
during the software life cycle  
âœ“ It is flexible and less expensive to change  
requirements and scope  
âœ“ Throughout the development stages  
changes can be done  
âœ“ This model is less costly compared to  
others  
âœ“ A customer can respond to each building  
âœ“ Errors are easy to be identified

**Disadvantages**

- It requires a good planning designing
- Problems might cause due to system  
    architecture as such not all requirements  
    collected up front for the entire software  
    lifecycle
- Each iteration phase is rigid and does not  
    overlap each other
- Rectifying a problem in one unit requires  
    correction in all the units and consumes a  
    lot of time

**Why choose Incremental Software Development Methodology**

- Requirements of the system are  
    clearly understood
- When demand for an early release of  
    a product arises
- When software engineering team  
    are not very well skilled or trained
- When high-risk features and goals  
    are involved
- Such methodology is more in use for  
    web application and product based  
    companies
