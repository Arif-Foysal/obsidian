## Practice Problems(page-293)

1. What is the relationship between a firm’s total revenue, profit, and total cost? 
2. Give an example of an opportunity cost that an accountant would not count as a cost. Why would the accountant ignore this cost? 
3. What is marginal product, and what does it mean if it is diminishing? 
**Ans:**
**Marginal product (MP)** is the **additional output** produced by **adding one more unit of an input**, while keeping other inputs constant.
Marginal Product (MP)=Change in Output/Change in Input​

**Diminishing marginal product** means:

> As you add more units of an input (like workers), the **extra output from each additional unit gets smaller**.


4. Draw a production function that exhibits diminishing marginal product of labor. Draw the associated total-cost curve. (In both cases, be sure to label the axes.) Explain the shapes of the two curves you have drawn. 

5. Define total cost, average total cost, and marginal cost. How are they related? 
6. Draw the marginal-cost and average-total-cost curves for a typical firm. Explain why the curves have the shapes that they do and why they intersect where they do. 
7. How and why does a firm’s average-total-cost curve differ in the short run compared with the long run? 
8. Define economies of scale and explain why they might arise. Define diseconomies of scale and explain why they might arise.

8. **Economies of scale** occur when **a firm’s long-run average total cost (ATC) decreases** as the **quantity of output increases**.

	In simpler terms:
> The more you produce, the cheaper each unit becomes.

**Diseconomies of scale** occur when **a firm’s long-run average total cost increases** as **output increases**.

In other words:

> Producing more makes each unit more expensive.
