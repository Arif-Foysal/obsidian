A **perfectly competitive market** has:

1. **Many firms**
2. **Homogeneous (identical) products**
3. **Free entry and exit** in the long run
4. **Price-taking firms** – no single firm can influence the price

## 🎯 **Short-run Output Decision**

The goal of a firm = **Maximize Profit**
### 🧮 **Profit = TR - TC**
Where:

- **TR** (Total Revenue) = Price × Quantity
- **TC** (Total Cost) = Average Cost × Quantity

## 📈 **Revenue Structure in Perfect Competition**

Since the firm is a **price taker**, the **market price is constant** for all output levels.

That means:
Price = AR = MR

## 📏 **Marginal Principle (MR = MC Rule)**

To maximize profit, firms follow this rule:

- **If MR > MC** → Increase output
    
- **If MR < MC** → Decrease output
    
- **Best output level** → where **MR = MC**

## 💰 **Profit Possibilities in Short Run**

1. **Supernormal Profit**
    
    - TR > TC
        
    - **P > AC**
        
2. **Normal Profit (Zero Economic Profit)**
    
    - TR = TC
        
    - **P = AC**
        
3. **Loss**
    
    - TR < TC
        
    - **P < AC**

## 🚪 **Shut-down Rule**

In the short run, even if a firm is making a loss, it may continue to operate if it can cover **variable costs**.

### Conditions:

- **If P > AVC** → Operate
    
- **If P < AVC** → Shut down
    

**Shut-down price** = minimum of AVC

---

## 🔁 **Long-Run Equilibrium Conditions**

A market is in long-run equilibrium when:

1. **Quantity supplied = Quantity demanded**
    
2. **Each firm maximizes profit** (MR = MC)
    
3. **Zero economic profit** → **P = AC**
    

No incentive for firms to enter or exit.
