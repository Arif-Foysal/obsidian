Every so often the operating system will

defragment the drive automatically and you don't need to

worry about it but you can manually defragment a drive in Windows if you want to.

To kick off a manual defragmentation,

open up the `disk defragmenter tool` bundled with the OS.

Type disk defragmenter.

When it launches,

you'll be given a list of disks which can be defragmented along with buttons to analyze

the potential gains from running a defrag or

defragmentation and to run the defrag itself.
