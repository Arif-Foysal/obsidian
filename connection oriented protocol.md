#networking #tcp #protocol 

In a connection oriented protocol, before one application process can begin to send data to another, the two processes must **handshake** first with each other. [[TCP]] is a connection oriented protocol.

[[connectionless protocol]]s are the opposite of that. E.g. [[UDP]]
