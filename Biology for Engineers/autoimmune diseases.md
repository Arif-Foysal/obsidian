## What are autoimmune diseases?

Auto-immune diseases are diseases where the immune system mounts a response against normal components of the body, causing it to attack and damage your body's own tissues.

Some common autoimmune diseases are: multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic vasculitis.
