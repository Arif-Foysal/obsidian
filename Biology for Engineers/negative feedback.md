Negative feedback mechanisms reduce output or activity to return an organ or system to its normal range of functioning. 

**Regulation of blood pressure** is an example of negative feedback. Blood vessels have sensors called
baroreceptors that detect if blood pressure is too high or too low and send a signal to the [[hypothalamus]]. The hypothalamus then sends a message to the [[heart]], blood vessels, and [[kidney]]s, which act as effectors in [[blood pressure]] regulation. If blood pressure is too high, the heart rate decreases as the blood vessels increase in diameter (vasodilation), while the kidneys retain less
water. These changes would cause the blood pressure to return to its normal range. The process reverses when blood pressure decreases, causing blood vessels to constrict and the kidney to increase water retention.

Temperature control is another negative feedback mechanism. Nerve cells relay information about body temperature to the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus then signals several effectors to return the body temperature to 37 degrees Celsius (the set point). The effectors may signal the sweat glands to cool the skin and stimulate vasodilation so the body can give off more heat.

If body temperature is below the set point, muscles shiver to generate heat and the constriction of the blood vessels helps the body retain heat. This example is very complex because the hypothalamus can change the bodyâ€™s temperature set point, such as raising it during  a fever to help fight an infection. Both internal and external events can induce negative feedback mechanisms.
