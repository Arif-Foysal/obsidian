A pathogen is a bacterium, virus, parasite or fungus that
can cause disease within the body. Each pathogen is made
up of several subparts, usually unique to that specific
pathogen and the disease it causes. 
## How does body produce [[antibody]] for a specific pathogen?
The subpart of a pathogen that causes the formation of antibodies is called an antigen. The antibodies produced in
response to the pathogen’s antigen are an important part
of the immune system. You can consider antibodies as
the soldiers in your body’s defense  system.  Each antibody, or soldier, in our system is trained to recognize one specific antigen. We have thousands of different antibodies in our bodies. When the human body is exposed to an [[antigen]] for the first time, it takes time for the immune system to respond and produce [[antibody|antibodies]] specific to that [[antigen]].

In the meantime, the person is [[susceptible to]] becoming ill.
Once the antigen-specific antibodies are produced, they work with the rest of the immune system to destroy the pathogen and stop the disease.

>[!Note]
>Antibodies to one pathogen generally don’t protect against another pathogen except when two pathogens are very similar to each other, like cousins.
