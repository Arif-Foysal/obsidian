[[homeostasis]] regulates an organismâ€™s internal environment and maintains a stable, constant condition of properties like temperature and pH. Homeostasis can be influenced by either
internal or external conditions and is maintained by many different mechanisms. All homeostatic control mechanisms have at least three interdependent components for the
variable being regulated:
- A sensor or receptor detects changes in the internal or external environment. An example is peripheral chemoreceptors, which detect changes in blood pH.
- The integrating center or control center receives information from the sensors and initiates the response to maintain homeostasis. The most important example is the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that controls everything from body temperature toheart rate, blood pressure, satiety (fullness), and circadian rhythms (sleep and wake cycles).
-  An effector is any organ or tissue that receives information from the integrating center and acts to bring about the changes needed to maintain homeostasis. One example is the kidney, which retains water if blood pressure is too low. 

The sensors, integrating center, and effectors are the basic components of every homeostatic response. [[positive feedback]] and [[negative feedback]] are more complicated mechanisms that enable these three basic components to maintain homeostasis for more complex physiological processes.
