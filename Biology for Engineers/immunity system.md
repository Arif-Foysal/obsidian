## Types of immunity

1. **Active Immunity**
2. **Passive Immunity**
3. **Innate Immunity**
4. **Adaptive Immunity**

### Active Immunity
Active immunity is a type of immunity that is created by our own immune system when we come in contact with a harmful [[pathogen]].

We are exposed to these throughout our day, it could be when we eat, breathe or even what we touch. Luckily, most of these will not result in any harmful diseases, as our immune system works to ward them off.

Another crucial function that active immunity undertakes is protection for a long time in the form of [[immunological memory]]. This memory contains cells B & T that work to recognize the pathogens. Although these cells circulate in our body at a very low level, once they sense an outside invader, they start to multiply in number and send signals to all other organs of the immune system to activate
themselves.

The importance of active immunity is:
•Quick response to outside invader
•Highly specific, so the immune system is ready when the [[pathogen]] is encountered. 

The one thing that drives active immunity most are vaccines. When an individual takes a [[vaccine]], their immune system treats it like any other exposure, while doing so,
it generates an immunological memory. As vaccines are developed to not cause illness, the body gains the benefits of the exposure without having to fight off the particular infection. In short, it prepares our immune system for a future encounter with the infection and provides us protection.
