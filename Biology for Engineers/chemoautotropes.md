Chemoautotrophs are primarily bacteria and
archaea that are found in rare ecosystems where
sunlight is not available, such as those associated
with dark caves or hydrothermal vents at the
bottom of the ocean. Many chemoautotrophs in
hydrothermal vents use hydrogen sulfide (H2S),
which is released from the vents as a source of
chemical energy; this allows them to synthesize complex
organic molecules, such as glucose, for their own
energy and, in turn, supplies energy to the rest of the
ecosystem.

Swimming shrimp, a few squat lobsters, and hundreds of vent mussels are seen at a hydrothermal vent at the bottom of the ocean. As no sunlight penetrates to this depth, the ecosystem is supported by chemoautotrophic bacteria and organic material that sinks from the oceanâ€™s surface. This picture was taken in 2006 at the submerged NW Eifuku volcano off the coast of Japan by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The summit of this highly active volcano lies 1535 m below the surface.
