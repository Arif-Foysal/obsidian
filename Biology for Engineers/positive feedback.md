**Positive feedback is a mechanism in which an output is enhanced in order to maintain homeostasis.**
Positive feedback mechanisms are designed to accelerate or enhance the output created by a stimulus that has already been activated. Positive feedback mechanisms are designed to push levels out of normal ranges. To achieve this, a series of events initiates a cascading process that builds to increase the effect of the stimulus. This process can be beneficial but is rarely used because it may become uncontrollable. 

A positive feedback example is **blood platelet accumulation and aggregation, which in turn causes blood clotting in response to an injury of the blood vessels**.
