Deoxyribonucleic acid (abbreviated DNA) is the [[molecule]] that carries genetic information for the development and functioning of an [[organism]]. DNA is made of two linked strands that wind around each other to resemble a twisted ladder — a shape known as a [[double helix]]. Each strand has a backbone made of alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups. Attached to each sugar is one of four bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) or thymine (T). The two strands are connected by chemical bonds between the bases: adenine bonds with thymine, and cytosine bonds with guanine. The sequence of the bases along DNA’s backbone encodes biological information, such as the instructions for making a protein or RNA molecule.

The length of DNA is determined by the number of [[nucleotide]] pairs present in it.
