### What is noncommunicable diseases? Give some examples. Mention their impact on health.
Non-communicable diseases are diseases that are not spread through infection or through other people.

Non-communicable diseases include- [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], cancer, [[diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]], parkinson's disease, [[autoimmune diseases]] and others. NCDs may be [[chronic diseases]] or [[acute diseases]]. 

Non-communicable diseases are collectively responsible for almost 70% of all deaths worldwide.

More than three-quarters of all NCD deaths, and 86% of the 17 million people who died prematurely, or before reaching 70 years of age, occur in low- and middle-income countries.[who](https://www.who.int/health-topics/noncommunicable-diseases#tab=tab_1)

### Explain why the rate of noncommunicable diseases are increasing? How can these diseases be prevented?

There are many reasons why the rate of noncommunicable diseases are on the rise, including-

- **Unhealthy Diet:**
	The consumption of processed foods high in sugars, unhealthy fats, and salt has become increasingly common. This can lead to obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Frequent consumption of fast food, sugary beverages, and snacks can significantly impact health negatively over time.
- **Sedentary Lifestyle:**
	Several studies show that physical inactivity increases the risk of many adverse health conditions, including the world’s major non-communicable diseases (NCDs) of coronary heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes, and breast and colon cancers, and shortens life expectancy.
- **Tobacco and Alcohol Use:**
	Individuals who smokes tobacco and consumes alcohol are more likely to develop [[chronic diseases|chronic health conditions]]. 
- **Environmental Factor:**
	Pollution, exposure to harmful chemicals, and other environmental factors can also contribute to the development of NCDs. Air pollution, for instance, has been linked to [[respiratory system|respiratory]] diseases such as [[asthma]] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

To design a lifestyle aimed at preventing these diseases, a focus on healthy dietary habits is crucial.

- [ ] Review below part #todo 
- **Whole Foods:** Emphasize a diet rich in whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins (like poultry, fish, beans, and nuts), and healthy fats (such as olive oil, avocados, and fatty fish like salmon).
    
- **Reduce Processed Foods:** Minimize intake of processed foods high in sugars, unhealthy fats, and sodium. This includes fast food, sugary snacks, and processed meats.
    
- **Limit Sugar and Salt:** Reduce consumption of sugary beverages, desserts, and snacks. Be mindful of hidden sugars in sauces, dressings, and packaged foods. Also, limit salt intake by avoiding excessively salty snacks and processed foods.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day and limit consumption of sugary drinks and excessive caffeine.
- **Avoid Tobacco and Limit Alcohol:** Quit smoking if you're a smoker, and limit alcohol consumption to moderate levels (if you choose to drink), following recommended guidelines.

### Do you think we need a change in diet for a 95 kg 130 cm pregnant woman? Give reasons and possible changes you want to recommend in diet. This person has gestational diabetes (diabetes in pregnancy period).

Yes, a change in diet is crucial for a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes, especially if she is overweight or obese (95 kg at 130 cm would indicate severe obesity). 
- **Avoid Sugery Food**
	Gestational diabetes requires careful management of blood sugar levels to ensure the health of both the mother and the baby. So she needs to avoid food that contains high amount of sugar.
- **Healthy Fats:** Incorporate sources of healthy fats into your diet, such as avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil. These fats can help improve insulin sensitivity and promote overall heart health. However, it's essential to consume them in moderation as they are calorie-dense.
- **Fruits in Moderation:** While fruits contain natural sugars, they also provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Opt for whole fruits rather than fruit juices, and consume them in moderation. **Berries, apples, and citrus fruits** are good choices because they have a lower glycemic index. 
- **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support overall health. Limit sugary beverages and opt for water, herbal teas, or sparkling water instead.
- **Portion Control:** Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid consuming too many carbohydrates at once, which can lead to spikes in blood sugar levels.

### Name the specific ways to control your sugar, salt and fat intake.

Sugar intake can be reduced by-
- Eating fresh fruit and raw vegetables as snacks instead of sugary snacks.
- Avoiding processed foods.
- Eat fresh fruits instead of fruit juice.
- Reduce taking [[simple carbohydrates]](soft drinks, candy). Eat [[complex carbohydrates]](rice, breads, pasta, whole grains) instead.

Salt intake can be reduced by-
- Limiting the amount of salt and high sodium condiments when cooking and preparing foods.
- Not having salt or high-sodium sauces on the table.
- Limiting the consumption of salty snacks.
- Choosing products with lower sodium content.

Fat intake can be reduced by-
- Steaming or boiling instead of frying when cooking.
- Replacing butter, lard and ghee with oils rich in [[polyunsaturated fats]].
- Eating reduced-fat dairy foods and lean meats, or trimming visible fat from meat.
- limiting the consumption of baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods.
