Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

This is how we write python on obsidian-
```python
import time
name=input("What's your name")
print("Your name is ",name)
```

This is an inline math expression $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$
