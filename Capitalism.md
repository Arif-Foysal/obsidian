Capitalism is an economic system in which private individuals and businesses primarily own and control the means of production and distribution. The key features of capitalism include free markets, profit motive, and limited government intervention, private property rights. 


### **Strengths:** 

- **Efficiency:** Capitalism promotes efficiency through market competition, as businesses strive to produce goods and services at lower costs and higher quality to attract customers. 
- **Innovation and Entrepreneurship:** The profit motive encourages innovation and risk-taking, leading to technological advancements, new products, and economic growth. 
- **Individual Freedom:** Capitalism emphasizes individual freedom and allows individuals to make choices regarding employment, consumption, and investment. 
- **Variety of Goods and Services:** Capitalism offers a wide array of goods and services as producers respond to consumer demand and preferences.

### **Weaknesses:** 
- **Income Inequality:** Capitalism can lead to income disparities, where wealth and resources are **concentrated** in the hands of a few, creating social and economic inequalities. 
- **Market Failures:** Unregulated markets can experience failures such as monopolies, externalities (costs or benefits not reflected in market prices), and information asymmetry, which may result in inefficient outcomes. 
- **Lack of Social Safety Nets:** Capitalism's focus on individual freedom and limited government intervention can lead to inadequate social safety nets, leaving some individuals vulnerable in times of economic hardship.
