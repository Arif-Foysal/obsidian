### 1.
The best technology acquisition method for "Lichi" would be **licensing**. This allows "Lichi" to use "Mapple’s" superior memory chip technology quickly and with lower investment compared to developing its own or acquiring the entire company.
### Why Licensing?

- **Cost-effective**: Licensing involves lower upfront costs compared to R&D or mergers and acquisitions.
- **Quick Access**: It allows rapid adoption of technology without delays in development.
- **Reduced Risk**: "Lichi" avoids the risk of failure in chip development or the costs of buying "Mapple."
- **Focus on Core Competencies**: "Lichi" can focus on its strengths in computer manufacturing, while using "Mapple's" expertise for memory chips.
### 2.
The NPV method is used to evaluate the profitability of a project or investment by calculating the present value of cash flows (both inflows and outflows) discounted at a given interest rate. The formula for NPV is:
$$\text{NPV} = \sum{\frac{Ct}{(1+r)^t}}-I$$

If the projects are considered **independent**, it means the decision to accept or reject one project does not affect the other. Therefore, each project should be evaluated separately using the given interest rate (which is often used as the discount rate).

You would apply the NPV method to each project individually, the answer will be the same because:
- **Independent Projects**: Since the projects are independent, the decision on one does not affect the other, so each project is evaluated on its own NPV.
- **Interest Rate**: The same interest rate (discount rate) is applied to all projects, meaning the present value of future cash flows is calculated consistently across projects.
### Example Calculation:
Let's assume we have two projects with the following cash flows and a discount rate of 10%:

- **Project A**: Initial investment of \$10,000, cash inflows of \$4,000 per year for 4 years.
- **Project B**: Initial investment of \$15,000, cash inflows of \$6,000 per year for 4 years.

We’ll calculate the NPV for each project separately.

#### Project A:
$$\text{NPV}_A = \frac{4000}{(1 + 0.10)^1} + \frac{4000}{(1 + 0.10)^2} + \frac{4000}{(1 + 0.10)^3} + \frac{4000}{(1 + 0.10)^4} - 10000$$

#### Project B:
$$\text{NPV}_B = \frac{6000}{(1 + 0.10)^1} + \frac{6000}{(1 + 0.10)^2} + \frac{6000}{(1 + 0.10)^3} + \frac{6000}{(1 + 0.10)^4} - 15000$$
### 3.
In this scenario, the product with a **high market share** but **low market growth** should be placed in the **"Cash Cow"** category of the **BCG (Boston Consulting Group) matrix**.
That is because, 
- **High Market Share**: The product dominates its market, which is a key characteristic of a "Cash Cow."
- **Low Market Growth**: The market is not growing significantly, indicating that the product is in a mature industry or phase.
- **Loyal Customer Base**: Despite low growth, the product continues to generate steady revenue from existing loyal customers, another trait of a "Cash Cow.
### Next Steps for the Product:
1. **Maximize Cash Flow**: Since "Cash Cows" typically generate more cash than they consume, the company should focus on maintaining its market position while minimizing additional investment.
2. **Optimize Costs**: Focus on cost efficiency and profitability to continue extracting value from the product.
3. **Support Other Products**: Use the profits generated by the "Cash Cow" to invest in other parts of the business, such as "Stars" (high growth, high market share) or "Question Marks" (high growth, low market share).
4. **Maintain Customer Loyalty**: Continue marketing efforts aimed at loyal customers, possibly offering special promotions or improving the customer experience to sustain their interest.
5. **Product Innovation or Diversification**: Consider incremental innovation or launching related products to keep the existing customer base engaged and extend the product’s lifecycle.
### 4.
**Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)** is a key concept in inventory management that determines the optimal order quantity that minimizes the total costs associated with inventory. The EOQ model helps companies strike a balance between the costs of ordering and holding inventory, ensuring efficient stock management.

### Significance of EOQ in Inventory Management:

EOQ is important because it helps organizations:

1. **Minimize Total Costs**: By optimizing order quantity, EOQ minimizes the sum of ordering and holding costs.
2. **Avoid Stockouts**: Helps maintain an adequate inventory level to meet customer demand without overstocking.
3. **Improved Cash Flow**: By not over-investing in excess inventory, companies free up capital for other areas of the business.
### How EOQ Minimizes Total Inventory Costs:

EOQ minimizes inventory costs by finding the balance point where the sum of **ordering costs** and **holding costs** is the lowest. If a company orders too frequently, its ordering costs will be high, but if it orders too infrequently and holds a large stock, its holding costs will be high. EOQ finds the sweet spot between these two extremes.

In an EOQ diagram, two curves are plotted:
- **Ordering Costs**: This decreases as the order quantity increases since fewer orders are placed.
- **Holding Costs**: This increases as the order quantity increases because more inventory is held.
- **Total Cost**: This is the sum of ordering and holding costs, and it is minimized at the point where the two curves intersect. This intersection is the EOQ.

### 5. 
**Technology management** plays a critical role in helping organizations gain and sustain a **competitive advantage**. By effectively managing technology, organizations can:

- **Enhance efficiency**: Streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve productivity.
- **Drive innovation**: Foster new product development and improve existing offerings, enabling differentiation from competitors.
- **Improve customer experience**: By adopting new technologies, companies can meet or exceed customer expectations, improving satisfaction and loyalty.
- **Increase market responsiveness**: Organizations can quickly adapt to changes in the market by leveraging the latest technological advancements.
In essence, well-managed technology allows companies to be **more agile, efficient, and innovative**, giving them an edge in the competitive landscape.

### Key Challenges in Integrating New Technologies

When organizations attempt to integrate new technologies, they face several challenges:

1. **Cost of Implementation**: The upfront costs of new technologies, including infrastructure, training, and integration, can be significant.
2. **Resistance to Change**: Employees may resist adopting new systems due to fear of job displacement or the complexity of learning new processes.
3. **Compatibility Issues**: New technology must integrate smoothly with existing systems, which can be difficult if older infrastructure is not designed for compatibility.
4. **Security Concerns**: New technologies often introduce security risks, requiring organizations to reassess data protection and cybersecurity strategies.
5. **Rapid Obsolescence**: Technology evolves quickly, so organizations must stay ahead of trends to ensure that investments don’t become outdated too soon.

### Example: Technology Management in Action (Amazon)

Let's say **Amazon** is an excellent example of effective technology management. The company continually integrates advanced technologies like **AI, automation, and cloud computing** to stay ahead of its competitors.
- **AI and Machine Learning**: Amazon uses AI to enhance its recommendation engine, which improves customer experience by suggesting products that are relevant to individual shoppers.
- **Automation**: In its warehouses, Amazon employs robots to manage inventory and streamline order fulfillment, greatly reducing labor costs and errors.
- **Cloud Computing (AWS)**: Through its cloud platform, AWS, Amazon not only revolutionized its own IT infrastructure but also turned it into a massive revenue stream by offering cloud services to other businesses.
### Rules of Technology Management Applied:
1. **Strategic Alignment**: Amazon aligns its technology initiatives (AI, automation) with its business goals of efficiency and customer satisfaction.
2. **Continuous Innovation**: The company continuously adopts emerging technologies to stay ahead of competitors and meet changing market demands.
3. **Risk Management**: By adopting scalable, flexible technologies (like cloud computing), Amazon mitigates the risks associated with rapid technological change.
