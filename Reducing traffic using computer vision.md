**Summery:**

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
    
    - CCTV cameras are installed along roads to monitor traffic activity.
        
    - The system uses **object detection** to identify vehicles, helmets, and license plates in real-time.
        
2. **Traffic Rule Enforcement**:
    
    - Detects whether bike riders are wearing helmets.
        
    - Extracts license plate information from vehicles violating traffic rules (e.g., not wearing helmets).
        
    - Automates penalties or fines for violators, reducing the need for manual intervention.
        
3. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
    
    - Uses annotated datasets (e.g., helmet, license plate, and vehicle detection) to train an object detection model (YOLOv5).
        
    - Analyzes traffic patterns and violations to identify high-risk areas or behaviors.
        
4. **Automated Alerts and Actions**:
    
    - Detects accidents, illegal parking, or other road blockages in real-time.
        
    - Can trigger alerts for authorities to respond quickly, reducing congestion caused by incidents.
