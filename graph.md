A graph is a non-linear [[data structures|data structure]] which consists of [[vertices]]/nodes connected by [[edges]]/arcs. Graph is used to represent relationship between different [[entity|entities]]. 
Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and analyze graphs, solving various problems like finding shortest path or detecting cycles.
