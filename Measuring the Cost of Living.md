CPI often overestimates the inflation. That is because:

### Theoretical

1. Which do you think has a greater effect on the CPI: a 10 percent increase in the price of chicken or a 10 percent increase in the price of caviar? Why?
    
2. Describe the three problems that make the CPI an imperfect measure of the cost of living.
    
3. If the price of imported French wine rises, is the CPI or the GDP deflator affected more? Why?
    

4. Over a long period of time, the price of a candy bar rose from $0.20 to $1.20. Over the same period, the CPI rose from 150 to 300. Adjusted for overall inflation, how much did the price of the candy bar change?

5. Explain the meaning of nominal interest rate and real interest rate. How are they related?

**Answers:**

1. **Chicken has a greater effect** because it's a common item in most households, so it has a larger weight in the CPI than caviar, which is rarely purchased.

2. The three problems are:

   * **Substitution bias** (consumers switch to cheaper goods),
   * **Introduction of new goods** (CPI may not reflect their benefits),
   * **Unmeasured quality changes** (quality improvements may be mistaken for price increases).

3. **CPI is affected more** because it includes the prices of all goods bought by consumers, including imports. The **GDP deflator excludes imports**.

4. The real price change:
   \$0.20 × (300/150) = \$0.40 (adjusted starting price).
   Since it rose to \$1.20, **real price tripled** (\$1.20 ÷ \$0.40 = 3).

5. **Nominal interest rate** is the stated rate without adjusting for inflation.
   **Real interest rate** is adjusted for inflation.
   **Relation:**
   Real = Nominal – Inflation rate.
