#Graph #data-structure #Algorithm 

Itâ€™s a method to represent a [[graph]] using [[2D matrix]] where rows and columns represent [[vertices]]/nodes, and each entity in the matrix (the intersection point, `k[i][j]`) represents the weight of the edge between those vertices.

Representation of [[undirected graph]] using adjacency matrix:
