Elasticity measures **how much buyers and sellers respond to changes** in market conditions—like price, income, or availability of substitutes.

It helps us understand **how sensitive quantity demanded or supplied is to changes** in price or other factors.
In other words, it helps us to analyze supply and demand with a greater precition.


## 📉 **Price Elasticity of Demand (Ed)**

Price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded given a percent change in the price.

It tells us:
- If **price goes up**, how much **demand drops**
- If **price goes down**, how much **demand rises**


## Midpoint Formula for Ed

### 🧊 Example:

- Price rises from $2.00 to $2.20
- Quantity demanded drops from 10 to 8

## 📏 **Types of Price Elasticity of Demand**

| Elasticity Value | Type                | Behavior                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Ed = 0           | Perfectly Inelastic | Quantity doesn’t change at all                  |
| Ed < 1           | Inelastic           | Quantity changes a little                       |
| Ed = 1           | Unit Elastic        | Quantity changes exactly in proportion to price |
| Ed > 1           | Elastic             | Quantity changes more than the price change     |
| Ed = ∞           | Perfectly Elastic   | Buyers respond massively to tiny price changes  |

## 🧠 **What Affects Elasticity? (Determinants)**

1. **Necessities vs. Luxuries**
    - Necessities = Inelastic
    - Luxuries = Elastic
2. **Availability of Substitutes**
    - More substitutes = More elastic
3. **Time Horizon**
    - Short term = Inelastic
    - Long term = Elastic
4. **Market Definition**
    - Broad (food) = Inelastic
    - Narrow (ice cream) = Elastic
## 💰 **Elasticity and Total Revenue (TR)**

**TR = Q x P**

| Price Change | Elastic Demand  | Inelastic Demand |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------- |
| ↑ Price      | ↓ Total Revenue | ↑ Total Revenue  |
| ↓ Price      | ↑ Total Revenue | ↓ Total Revenue  |

## Income elasticity of demand
Income elasticity of demand measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in consumers’ income.

- **Normal Goods**: Ed > 0 (more income → more demand)   
- **Inferior Goods**: Ed < 0 (more income → less demand)

## 🛒 **Normal Goods**

These are goods that you **buy more of when your income increases**.

### 👉 Characteristics:

- Demand goes **up** when income goes **up**
- Positive income elasticity (Ed > 0)

### ✅ Examples:

- Clothes from a favorite brand
- Better quality food (organic, branded snacks)
- New electronics
- Dining at restaurants

## 🧺 **Inferior Goods**

These are goods that you **buy less of when your income increases**.

### 👉 Characteristics:

- Demand goes **down** when income goes **up**
- Negative income elasticity (Ed < 0)
### Examples:
- Instant noodles or very cheap food
- Second-hand clothes or used furniture
- Public transport (if people start taking Uber or buying cars instead)
