## ERD Exercise 01: Banking Enterprise
The bank is organized into branches. Each branch is located in a particular city and is identified by a unique name. The bank monitors the assets of each branch.

Bank employees are identified by their employee-id values. The bank administration stores the name and telephone number of each employee, the names of the employee's dependents, and the employee- id number of the employee's manager. The bank also keeps track of the employee's start date and, thus, length of employment.

Bank customers are identified by their customer-id values. The bank stores each customer's name, and the street and city where the customer lives. Customers may have accounts and can take out loans. A customer may be associated with a particular banker, who may act as a loan officer or personal banker for that customer.

Accounts can be held by more than one customer, and a customer can have more than one account. Each account is assigned a unique account number. The bank maintains a record of each account's balance, and the most recent date on which the account was accessed by each customer holding the account.
