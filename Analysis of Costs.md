## Short run costs
### ðŸ”¹ **Short-Run Costs**
- **Some factors (like capital) are fixed** â€” you can't change everything.
- Only **variable inputs (like labor)** can be adjusted.
- Includes:
    - **Fixed Costs (FC):** Don't change with output (e.g. rent, salaried staff)
    - **Variable Costs (VC):** Change with output (e.g. raw materials, hourly wages)
### ðŸ”¸ **Long-Run Costs**

- **All inputs are variable** â€” firms can scale up/down fully.
- Focus is on **choosing the best scale of operation** to minimize cost.

## Relationship between Average Cost and Marginal Cost

| Situation         | Relationship | What it Means                   |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **AC decreasing** | MC < AC      | Marginal cost pulls AC down     |
| **AC at minimum** | MC = AC      | Most efficient production point |
| **AC increasing** | MC > AC      | MC pulls AC up                  |
