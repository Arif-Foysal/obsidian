A constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is a type of problem-solving task in artificial intelligence (AI) where the goal is to find a solution that satisfies a set of constraints. CSPs are often used to model real-world problems, such as scheduling, resource allocation, and planning.

A CSP is defined by 3 components-
- **Variables:** The variables are the elements of the problem that need to be assigned values.
- **Domains:** The domains are the set of possible values that each variable can take.
- **Constraints:** The constraints are the rules that the variables must satisfy.
	Constrains can be defined two ways:
	- ==Implicit==
	- ==Explicit==
### Solution of a CSP
Solution of a CSP is an assignments satisfying all constrains.
