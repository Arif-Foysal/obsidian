**Manhattan** distance is a [[metric]] that measures the distance between two points in a grid or rectangular space. It is calculated by adding the absolute difference between the x and y coordinates of the two points.

For example, the Manhattan distance between the points (1, 2) and (3, 4) is |1 - 3| + |2 - 4| = 5.

Manhattan distance is a common metric used in pathfinding algorithms, such as the A* algorithm. It is also used in other applications, such as image processing and machine learning.

Here is the formula for calculating the Manhattan distance between two points(x1,y1) and (x2,y2):

```
Manhattan distance = |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|
```
