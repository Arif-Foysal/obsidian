A heuristic function, also known simply as a heuristic, is a function used in artificial intelligence and problem-solving algorithms to estimate the **cost or value** of reaching a goal state from a given state in a search space. It provides a way to evaluate how promising a particular state is in terms of finding an optimal solution without actually knowing the true cost or value.

Heuristic functions are commonly used in [[Informed search algorithm]] , such as A* (A-star), where they guide the search by providing additional knowledge or domain-specific information about the problem being solved. By using a heuristic function, the algorithm can prioritize the exploration of more promising paths or states, potentially avoiding unnecessary exploration of less favorable areas in the search space.
A heuristic function for **path finding** can be -
- [[Euclidian Distance]] or **straight line distance**
- [[Manhattan Distance]]
