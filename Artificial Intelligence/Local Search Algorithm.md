Local Search can be used when
- The [[State space]] is too large
- When we don't need to store the path to goal (I.g. [[8 Puzzle Problem]])
- [[optimization problem]]
## Examples of Local Search Algorithms
- [[Hill Climbing Search]]
- [[Simulated annealing (SA)]]
- 
## Properties of Local Search Algorithm
- 



### Advantages
- Fast Algorithm, since [[Time Complexity]] is good.
- Low [[Space Complexity]], requires less memory since we are not storing the path to memory.
- Good for large number of nodes.
### Disadvantages
- Not optimal. It does not guarantee the optimal solution because the algorithm can get stuck in [[local optima]] or local maxima/minima.
