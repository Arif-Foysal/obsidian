In the context of problem-solving and search algorithms, a relaxed problem refers to a simplified or modified version of the original problem that is easier to solve but provides useful information or insights that can help in solving the original problem.
The idea is to simplify the problem by relaxing some of the constraints or reducing the complexity, so it becomes easier to find a solution.
