****Greedy algorithms**** are a class of algorithms that make ****locally optimal**** choices at each step with the hope of finding a ****global optimum**** solution.
In other words, greedy algorithm is like a problem-solving strategy where you make the best choice at each step without thinking too much about the future.It's like going for the immediate advantage without worrying about the absolute best in the end.

- A greedy algorithm always makes the choice that looks best at this moment.
- We hope that a locally optimal choice will lead to a globally optimal.
- Greedy algorithms tend to be easier to code
