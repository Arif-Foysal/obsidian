#Machine-Learning 

Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are the two main types of machine learning. 

### **Supervised Learning:**
A type of machine learning algorithm that learns from labeled data, meaning we train the algorithm using data that is well-labeled.

Key Points:
- Supervised learning involves training a machine from labeled data.
- Labeled data consists of examples with the correct answer or classification.
- The machine learns the relationship between inputs (fruit images) and outputs (fruit labels).
- The trained machine can then make predictions on new,Â unlabeled data.

Supervised learning is classified into two categories of algorithms:

1. [[Classification]]
2. [[Regression]]
