An informed search algorithm is a search algorithm that uses additional information about the problem to guide the search process. This information is typically called a [[Heuristic Function]], and it is used to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from the current state to the goal state.

Informed search algorithms can be more efficient than uninformed search algorithms, as they can focus their search on the most promising states. However, they can also be more complex to implement, as they require the use of a [[heuristic function]].

Some examples of informed search algorithms include:

- [[A Star Search]]: A search is a heuristic search algorithm that uses a [[heuristic function]] to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from the current state to the goal state.
Here are some of the advantages of informed search algorithms:

- They can be more efficient than uninformed search algorithms, as they can focus their search on the most promising states.
- They can be used to solve problems that are not solvable by uninformed search algorithms.

Here are some of the disadvantages of informed search algorithms:

- They can be more complex to implement, as they require the use of a [[heuristic function]].
- The [[Heuristic Function]] may not be accurate, which can lead to suboptimal solutions.
