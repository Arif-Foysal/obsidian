A search problem in [[Artificial Intelligence]] is a problem that can be solved by searching through a [[State space]]. The [[State space]] is a set of possible states that the problem can be in, and the goal is to find a path from the initial state to a goal state.
A search problem can be defined by the following elements:

- **[[State space]]:** The set of all possible states that the problem can be in.
- **Start state:** The initial state of the problem.
- **Goal state(test):** The state that the problem is trying to achieve.
- **Transition function:** A function that maps from one state to a set of possible successor states.
- **Cost function:** A function that assigns a cost to each state or transition.
Sometimes, Transition Function and Cost Function are together called **Successor Function**
### Search Algorithm Properties
- [[Complete Algorithm]]
- [[Optimal Algorithm]]
- [[Time Complexity]]
- [[Space Complexity]]

There are many different search algorithms that can be used to solve search problems. Some of the most common algorithms include:
- [[Uniform Cost Search]]
- [[Breadth-first search]]
	- [[Greedy Breadth-First Search(GBFS)]]
- [[Depth-first search]]
- [[A* Search]]
	- [[A* tree search]]
	- [[A* Graph Search]]
