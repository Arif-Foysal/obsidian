### **Summary of Space-Based Architecture**

In traditional web-based business applications, the request flow typically starts at the web server, moves to the application server, and finally reaches the database server. While this works for a small user base, as the load increases, bottlenecks emerge at different layers—web server, application server, and database server.

- **Web Server Scaling**: Scaling out web servers is easy and inexpensive, but it often shifts the bottleneck to the application server.
- **Application Server Scaling**: Scaling application servers is more complex and expensive, usually pushing the bottleneck to the database.
- **Database Server Scaling**: Scaling the database is the most difficult and expensive, ultimately creating a triangular topology where the web servers are easy to scale, but the database is the hardest to scale.

In high-volume applications with large concurrent user loads, the database becomes the **final limiting factor** in transaction processing. While caching technologies and database scaling products can help, scaling out traditional applications for extreme loads remains challenging.

The **space-based architecture** pattern is designed to address these **scalability** and **concurrency issues**, making it ideal for applications with variable and unpredictable concurrent user volumes. It provides a more architectural solution to scalability rather than relying on retrofitting existing systems with caching or database scaling technologies.


## Pattern Description

### **Summary of Space-Based Architecture Pattern**

The **space-based architecture** (or **cloud architecture**) is designed to maximize scalability by eliminating the central database bottleneck. It uses **replicated in-memory data grids** instead of a central database, allowing high scalability and the ability to dynamically add or remove processing units based on the user load. This architecture removes the database constraint, enabling near-infinite scalability for applications, especially those with variable concurrent user volumes.

#### **Key Components**:

1. **Processing Unit**:
    
    - Contains the application components, including web-based components and backend business logic.
    - Can be deployed as a single unit for smaller applications, or multiple units for larger, functionally split applications.
    - Includes the application modules, an in-memory data grid, and optionally an asynchronous persistent store for failover.
    - Features a **replication engine** that synchronizes data changes across active processing units.
2. **Virtualized Middleware**:
    
    - Handles housekeeping, data synchronization, and request management.
    - Includes components such as the **messaging grid**, **data grid**, **processing grid**, and **deployment manager**.
    - These components can either be custom-built or obtained from third-party vendors.

The space-based architecture is ideal for applications like bidding auction sites that require rapid, scalable handling of numerous concurrent requests, where the database can no longer serve as the central point of scaling.
### **Pattern Dynamics of Space-Based Architecture**

The **magic** of the space-based architecture pattern lies in the **virtualized middleware components** and the **in-memory data grid** within each processing unit. These components manage **requests**, **sessions**, **data replication**, **distributed request processing**, and **process-unit deployment**, contributing to the architecture's high scalability and flexibility.

#### **Key Components of Virtualized Middleware**:

1. **Messaging Grid**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Handles input requests and session management.
    - **Functionality**: When a request arrives, the messaging grid identifies the available processing units and forwards the request to one. It can use algorithms like round-robin or more complex strategies to manage request distribution.
    - **Example**: If there are multiple processing units, the grid ensures the load is shared effectively.
2. **Data Grid**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Manages data replication between processing units.
    - **Functionality**: Ensures that every processing unit has identical data in its in-memory data grid. This is vital for ensuring consistent data availability across distributed processing units.
    - **Synchronization**: Data replication occurs asynchronously and extremely quickly, often in microseconds, ensuring that data updates are reflected across all units without delay.
3. **Processing Grid**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Manages distributed request processing when multiple processing units exist.
    - **Functionality**: Handles requests that require coordination between different types of processing units (e.g., order processing and customer processing units). It orchestrates the distribution of tasks between these units.
    - **Example**: For a complex request, the processing grid coordinates between different application parts, ensuring the request is processed efficiently.
4. **Deployment Manager**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Manages the dynamic scaling of processing units based on load.
    - **Functionality**: Continuously monitors response times and user load, dynamically starting or shutting down processing units. This is crucial for scaling the application up or down to meet changing demand.
    - **Example**: During high traffic, the manager deploys additional processing units; when the load decreases, it reduces resources to maintain efficiency.

### **Visual Representation**:

- **Messaging Grid**: Handles request routing between active processing units.
- **Data Grid**: Synchronizes data between units, ensuring consistency.
- **Processing Grid**: Coordinates distributed tasks across processing units.
- **Deployment Manager**: Monitors load and manages the dynamic scaling of units.



## Considerations
#### **Advantages**:

- **Scalable for Variable Load**: This architecture is ideal for applications with fluctuating or unpredictable user loads, such as **social media sites**, **bidding**, and **auction platforms**.
- **No Centralized Datastore**: Unlike traditional architectures, this pattern does not rely on a centralized database. Data is kept in-memory and replicated across multiple processing units, which can scale dynamically based on demand.
- **Memory Optimization**: By partitioning the data, often volatile transactional data is isolated from non-active data, which reduces the memory footprint of the in-memory data grid in each processing unit.

#### **Limitations**:

- **Not Ideal for Large-Scale Relational Databases**: This pattern is **not well suited for traditional large-scale relational database applications** with significant amounts of operational data. The pattern excels in dynamic, highly-scalable environments but can be cumbersome for systems reliant on extensive, structured data relationships.
    
- **Cost and Complexity**: Implementing space-based architecture can be **complex** and **expensive**. The infrastructure, replication mechanisms, and in-memory data grids require careful planning and resource allocation.
    

#### **Data Management**:

- While this pattern often uses **in-memory data grids** for fast data access, it may still include a **centralized datastore** for initial data load and persistence of updates. This approach maintains reliability in the face of failures and ensures consistency across distributed units.
    
- **Data Partitioning**: For performance optimization, **separate partitions** may be used to isolate frequently used or volatile data from less active datasets. This helps reduce the memory footprint on each processing unit, improving performance.
    

#### **Deployment Considerations**:

- The term **"cloud-based architecture"** is sometimes used as an alternative to **"space-based architecture"**. However, it's important to note that the pattern does not necessarily require cloud infrastructure. It can also be implemented on **local servers**, which makes it more flexible depending on the application’s hosting needs.

#### **Product Implementation**:

- Many architecture components can be implemented using third-party products, such as:
    - **GemFire**, **JavaSpaces**, **GigaSpaces**, **IBM Object Grid**, **nCache**, and **Oracle Coherence**.
- **Selecting Products**: The choice of products can vary in **cost** and **capabilities**, especially regarding **data replication times**. As an architect, it's essential to first define your specific goals and needs before choosing the appropriate products for implementation.
