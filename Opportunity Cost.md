## What is Opportunity/Marginal Cost?

**Opportunity cost** is the value of the **next best alternative** that you give up when you make a choice.

In other words, whenever you choose to do one thing, you're also choosing **not** to do something else â€” and the benefit you would have gotten from that "something else" is your opportunity cost.
