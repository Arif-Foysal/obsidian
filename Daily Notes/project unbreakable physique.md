**Date:** [[2024-09-19]]

It's the end of September now and I haven't done anything significant. Now I must do the work of 9 months in just 3 months! And it sucks. But I will reach my goals of 2024 no matter what is takes.

The rules are:
- [ ] Eat as much as possible.
- [ ] Workout at least 5 days a week.
- [ ] Sleep at least 8 hours a day
