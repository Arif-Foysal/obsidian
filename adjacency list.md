#Graph #Algorithm #data-structure 

Adjacency list is a technique used to represent a [[graph]]. The graph is represented using an array of [[linked list]], where each index of the array represents an [[vertices]]/node and each element of the [[linked list]] represents the adjacent [[vertices]].

However, adjacency list can be easily implemented using Array of [[vector in c++|vectors]] from [[standard template library(STL)]] in [[c++]]

### Example: Undirected unweighted graph using adjacency list

```
0-> 1 -> 4
1-> 0 -> 4 -> 3
2-> 1 -> 3
3-> 4 -> 1 -> 2
4-> 0 -> 1 -> 3
```
**Adjacency list representation using array of vectors:**
