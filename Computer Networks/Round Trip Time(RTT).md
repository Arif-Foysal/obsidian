Rount time trip(RTT) is the time required for small packet to travel from client to server and back.

RTT can be analyzed and determined by [[ping|pinging]] a certain address. It refers to the time taken by a network request to reach a destination and to revert back to the original source.
## What Are Common Factors that Affect RTT?

There are certain factors that can bring huge changes in the value of RTT. These are enlisted below:

- **Distance:** It is the length in which a signal travels for a request to reach the server and for a response to reach the browser,
- **Transmission medium:** The medium which is used to route a signal, which helps in faster transfer of request is transmitted.
- **Network hops:** It is the time that servers take to process a signal, on increasing the number of hops, RTT will also increase.
- **Traffic levels:** Round Trip Time generally increases when a network is having huge traffic which results in that, for low traffic RTT will also be less.
- **Server response time:** It is the time taken by a server to respond to a request which basically depends on the capacity of handling requests and also sometimes on the nature of the request.
