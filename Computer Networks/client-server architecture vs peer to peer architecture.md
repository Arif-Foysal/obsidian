| Client-Server                                                                        | Peer-to-peer                                                                                            |

| 1. Always on server needed                                                           | 1. No always on server needed                                                                           |
| 2. In Client-Server Network, Centralized server is used to store the data.           | 2. While in Peer-to-Peer Network, Each peer has its own data.                                           |
| 3. In Client-Server Network, Server respond the services which is request by Client. | 3. While in Peer-to-Peer Network, Each and every node can do both request and respond for the services. |
| 4. Costly.                                                                           | 4. Less costly.                                                                                         |
| 5. More stable.                                                                      | 5. Less stable.                                                                                         |
| 6. Used in both small and large networks.                                            | 6. Best suited with smaller networks with fewer than 10 computers.                                      |
