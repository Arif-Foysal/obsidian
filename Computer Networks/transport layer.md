Transport layer provides logical communication between application processes running on different hosts. Transport layer is the second layer in [[tcp-ip model]] and fourth layer in the [[osi model]]. 
## The job of transport layer
Transport layer,
- Provides service to the [[network layer]]
- Takes service from the [[application layer]]
### At the senders side
The transport layer receives data(message) from application layer and then performs segmentation, **divides the actual message** into segments, adds the **source** and **destinationâ€™s port numbers** into the **header** of the segment, and transfers the message to the [[network layer]].

### At the receivers side
The transport layer receives data from the Network layer, reassembles the segmented data, reads its header, identifies the port number, and forwards the message to the appropriate port in the Application layer.

## Responsibilities of transport layer
- Process to process delivery
- End to end connection between hosts
- [[multiplexing in transport layer|multiplexing]] and [[demultiplexing in transport layer|demultiplexing]]
- Congestion control
- Data integrity and error correction
- Flow control

### Multiplexing
The job of gathering data chunks at the source host from
different sockets, encapsulating each data chunk with header information to create segments and passing the segments to the network layer.
