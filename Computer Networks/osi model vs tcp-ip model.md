| TCP refers to Transmission Control Protocol.                                                                           | OSI refers to Open Systems Interconnection.                                                              |
| TCP/IP uses both the session and presentation layer in the application layer itself.                                   | OSI uses different session and presentation layers.                                                      |
| TCP/IP follows connectionless a horizontal approach.                                                                   | OSI follows a vertical approach.                                                                         |
| The Transport layer in TCP/IP does not provide assurance delivery of packets.                                          | In the OSI model, the transport layer provides assurance delivery of packets.                            |
| Protocols cannot be replaced easily in TCP/IP model.                                                                   | While in the OSI model, Protocols are better covered and are easy to replace with the technology change. |
| TCP/IP model network layer only provides connectionless (IP) services. The transport layer (TCP) provides connections. | Connectionless and connection-oriented services are provided by the network layer in the OSI model.      |
