#networking 

LAN or Local Area Network connects network devices in such a way that personal computers and workstations can share data, tools, and programs. The group of computers and devices are connected together by a switch, or stack of switches, using a private addressing scheme as defined by the TCP/IP protocol. Private addresses are unique in relation to other computers on the local network. Routers are found at the boundary of a LAN, connecting them to the larger WAN.

Data transmits at a very fast rate as the number of computers linked is limited. Early LANs had data rates in the 4 to 16 Mbps range. Today, speeds are normally 100 or 1000 Mbps. Propagation delay is very short in a LAN.

#### **Advantages:**

- Provides fast data transfer rates and high-speed communication.
- Easy to set up and manage.
- Can be used to share peripheral devices such as printers and scanners.
- Provides increased security and fault tolerance compared to WANs.

#### Disadvantages:

- Limited geographical coverage.
- Limited scalability and may require significant infrastructure upgrades to accommodate growth.
- May experience congestion and network performance issues with increased usage.
