WAN or Wide Area Network is a computer network that extends over a large geographical area, although it might be confined within the bounds of a state or country. WAN has a range of above 50 km. A WAN could be a connection of LAN connecting to other LANs via telephone lines and radio waves and may be limited to an enterprise (a corporation or an organization) or accessible to the public. The technology is high-speed and relatively expensive.

There are two types of WAN: Switched WAN and Point-to-Point WAN. WAN is difficult to design and maintain. Similar to a MAN, the fault tolerance of a WAN is less and there is more congestion in the network. A Communication medium used for WAN is PSTN or Satellite Link. Due to long-distance transmission, the noise and error tend to be more in WAN.

WAN’s data rate is slow about a 10th LAN’s speed since it involves increased distance and increased number of servers and terminals etc. The speed of WAN ranges from a few kilobits per second (Kbps) to megabits per second (Mbps). Propagation delay is one of the biggest problems faced here. Devices used for the transmission of data through WAN are Optic wires, Microwaves, and Satellites. An example of a Switched WAN is the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) network and Point-to-Point WAN is a dial-up line that connects a home computer to the Internet.

#### **Advantages:**

- Covers large geographical areas and can connect remote locations.
- Provides connectivity to the internet.
- Offers remote access to resources and applications.
- Can be used to support multiple users and applications simultaneously.

#### **Disadvantages:**

- Can be expensive to set up and maintain.
- Offers slower data transfer rates than LAN or MAN.
- May experience higher latency and longer propagation delays due to longer distances and multiple network hops.
- May have lower fault tolerance and security compared to LANs.
