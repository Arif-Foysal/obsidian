#networking 

This model does not differentiate the clients and the servers, In this each and every node is itself client and server. In [Peer-to-Peer Network](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-p2ppeer-to-peer-process/), Each and every node can do both request and respond for the services. In p2p network, the application exploits direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers.

- p2p architecture is less secure than [[client-server architecture]] because they function as both clients and servers. A denial of service attack may result from this.
