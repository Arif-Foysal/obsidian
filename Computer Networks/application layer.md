## What is the Application Layer?
The Application Layer is topmost layer in the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model. The application layer contains the communications protocols and interface methods used in process-to-process communications across an [Internet Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP) computer network. The application layer only standardizes communication and depends upon the underlying [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer "Transport layer") protocols to establish host-to-host data transfer channels and manage the data exchange in a [[client-server architecture]] or [[peer to peer(p2p) architecture]] networking model.
