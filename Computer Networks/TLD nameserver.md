The top level domain server ([TLD](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/top-level-domain/)) can be thought of as a specific rack of books in a library. This nameserver is the next step in the search for a specific IP address, and it hosts the last portion of a hostname (In example.com, the TLD server is “com”).
