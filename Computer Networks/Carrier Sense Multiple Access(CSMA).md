simple CSMA: **listen before transmit**:
- if channel sensed idle: transmit entire frame
- if channel sensed busy: defer transmission

>Human analogy: don’t interrupt others!

## CSMA/CD
CSMA with collision detection.

• collisions detected within short time
• colliding transmissions aborted, reducing channel wastage
• collision detection easy in wired, difficult with wireless
 human analogy: the polite conversationalist
