The packet received from the [Network layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-layer-services-packetizing-routing-and-forwarding/) is known as a frame in the [[Data link layer]]. At the sender’s side, DLL receives packets from the Network layer and divides them into small frames, then, sends each frame bit-by-bit to the [physical layer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/physical-layer-in-osi-model/). It also attaches some special bits (for error control and addressing) at the header and end of the frame. At the receiver’s end, DLL takes bits from the Physical layer organizes them into the frame, and sends them to the Network layer.
