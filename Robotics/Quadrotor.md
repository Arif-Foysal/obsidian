Quad-rotors consists of 4 independently controlled rotors, mounted in a rigid frame.

### Controlling position and orientation of a quad rotor

The position and orientation of a quad-rotor can be controlled by varying the speeds of the independent motors.

### Roll and pitch

If you rotate one rotor faster than the other, it will cause the robot to pitch in one direction. 

### Yaw motion 
If you wanna move the vehicle from one side to another, translating it along the [[horizontal]] direction,
Letâ€™s just say you want to go from point x to point y.

- Pitch the robot forward, so that the [[thrust vector]] points the horizontal direction. This allows the vehicle to accelerate forward.

- When you get close to the destination, you want to stop the vehicle, for that you have to pitch it in the opposite direction, creating a reverse thrust resulting the robot to slow down as it approaches the destination.

- Pitch the robot back to equilibrium.
