To answer this question, we first need to understand how the **Net Present Value (NPV)** method works and apply it to the scenario involving the given interest rate. 

### NPV Method Overview
The NPV method is used to evaluate the profitability of a project or investment by calculating the present value of cash flows (both inflows and outflows) discounted at a given interest rate. The formula for NPV is:

\[
\text{NPV} = \sum \frac{C_t}{(1 + r)^t} - I
\]

Where:
- \(C_t\) = cash inflow at time \(t\),
- \(r\) = discount rate (interest rate),
- \(t\) = time period,
- \(I\) = initial investment.

A positive NPV indicates that the project is profitable, while a negative NPV means it would result in a loss.

### Interest Rate and Independence
If the projects are considered **independent**, it means the decision to accept or reject one project does not affect the other. Therefore, each project should be evaluated separately using the given interest rate (which is often used as the discount rate).

### Applying the NPV Method:
You would apply the NPV method to each project individually using the following steps:

1. **Identify Cash Flows**: Determine the cash flows for each project over its lifespan.
2. **Discount the Cash Flows**: Apply the given interest rate to discount future cash flows to their present value.
3. **Calculate NPV**: Subtract the initial investment from the total discounted cash flows.
4. **Decision Rule**: If the NPV of a project is positive, it should be accepted. If negative, it should be rejected.

### Will the Answer Be the Same?

Yes, the answer will be the same because:
- **Independent Projects**: Since the projects are independent, the decision on one does not affect the other, so each project is evaluated on its own NPV.
- **Interest Rate**: The same interest rate (discount rate) is applied to all projects, meaning the present value of future cash flows is calculated consistently across projects.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume we have two projects with the following cash flows and a discount rate of 10%:

- **Project A**: Initial investment of \$10,000, cash inflows of \$4,000 per year for 4 years.
- **Project B**: Initial investment of \$15,000, cash inflows of \$6,000 per year for 4 years.

Weâ€™ll calculate the NPV for each project separately.

#### Project A:
$$\text{NPV}_A = \frac{4000}{(1 + 0.10)^1} + \frac{4000}{(1 + 0.10)^2} + \frac{4000}{(1 + 0.10)^3} + \frac{4000}{(1 + 0.10)^4} - 10000$$

#### Project B:
$$\text{NPV}_B = \frac{6000}{(1 + 0.10)^1} + \frac{6000}{(1 + 0.10)^2} + \frac{6000}{(1 + 0.10)^3} + \frac{6000}{(1 + 0.10)^4} - 15000$$

Would you like me to calculate the NPVs for these hypothetical projects to show how the results are obtained?
