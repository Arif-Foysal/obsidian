- **Planning**
- **Define Requirements**
- **Design and prototyping**
- **Software Development**
- **Testing**
- **Deployment**
- **Operations and Maintainance**

## Planning
- [[defining scope]]
- [[feasibility analysis]]
- [[benchmark study]]
## Requirement Analysis

Analyzing the Resources:
- Hardware
- Software
- Skilled people
- Time
## Designing and Prototyping

Visual representation of the project:
- Diagram
- Chart
**Prototype**: A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product.

## Maintenance
- post-release bug fixing
- check for improvement scope
- release newer versions
## Project scales

Deciding factors: duration, finance, resource
Small scale projects: some weeks
Mid scale projects: some months
Large scale projects: 1+ years
