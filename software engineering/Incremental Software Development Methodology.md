Incremental Model is a process of
software development where
requirements are broken down into
multiple standalone modules of
software development cycle.
Incremental development is done in
steps from analysis design,

implementation,

testing/verification, maintenance.


Each iteration passes through the
requirements, design, coding and
testing phases. And each
subsequent release of the system
adds function to the previous
release until all designed
functionality has been
implemented.

- System development is broken
down into many mini
development projects
- Partial systems are successively
built to produce a final total
system
- Highest priority requirement is
tackled first
- Once the requirement is
developed, requirement for that
increment are frozen

**Advantages**
The software will be generated quickly
during the software life cycle
✓ It is flexible and less expensive to change
requirements and scope
✓ Throughout the development stages
changes can be done
✓ This model is less costly compared to
others
✓ A customer can respond to each building
✓ Errors are easy to be identified

**Disadvantages**
- It requires a good planning designing
- Problems might cause due to system
architecture as such not all requirements
collected up front for the entire software
lifecycle
- Each iteration phase is rigid and does not
overlap each other
- Rectifying a problem in one unit requires
correction in all the units and consumes a
lot of time

**Why choose Incremental Software Development Methodology**
- Requirements of the system are
clearly understood
- When demand for an early release of
a product arises
- When software engineering team
are not very well skilled or trained
- When high-risk features and goals
are involved
- Such methodology is more in use for
web application and product based
companies
