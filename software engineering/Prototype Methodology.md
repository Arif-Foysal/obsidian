Instead of developing a full-fledged software, the prototype model allows developers to work on the prototype version of the final product. The prototype is then made available for customer testing, evaluation, and feedback. 

Based on the gathered feedback, the prototype goes through several iterations of refinement until it’s deemed satisfactory by the customer. The appeal of the prototype approach is its rigorous evaluation that uncovers possible issues before actual development begins.

**Advantages**
- Good in ironing out potential issues in the early development stage, which greatly reduces product failure risk.
- Ensures the customer is happy with the ‘product’, before real development started.
- Build rapport with the customer early on with the discussions, which helps throughout the project.
- Gather detailed information with the prototype, which is later on used in building the final version.

**Disadvantages**
- Excessive to and from in testing out the prototype with the customer can delay the development timeline.
- The customer’s expectations of the actual product may not align with the prototype.
- There’s a risk of cost overrun as the works on the prototype are often paid for by the developer.
**When to use prototype methodology**
The prototype model is ideal when you’re building software with many unknowns. For example, an online platform with intense user interaction. With the prototype model, you can find out what works best with users and reduce the risk of developing the actual product.
