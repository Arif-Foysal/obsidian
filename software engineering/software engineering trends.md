## Terminologies
### API
API is an intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
#### Types of API
- Open APIs: also known as external or public APIs, are available to developers and other users with minimal restrictions.
- Internal APIs: They are designed to be hidden from external users. They are used within different teams of a company to share resources.
- Partner APIs: Partner APIs are technically similar to open APIs, but they feature restricted access, often controlled through a third-party API gateway.
- Composite APIs: Composite APIs allow developers to access several endpoints in one call. These could be different endpoints of a single API, or they could be multiple services or data sources.
#### API Protocols

##### REST (representational state transfer)
A web service can only be treated as a RESTful service if it follows the constraints of being-
1. Client Server
2. Stateless
3. Cacheable
4. Layered System
5. Uniform Interface
REST requires low bandwidth, and response format can be plain text, HTML, XML, JSON, etc.
##### SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol)
 It requires high bandwidth and can only work with XML format.


#### [[JSON(Javascript Object Notation)]]
JSON is a lightweight, open standard text format that is designed for human readable data interchange.

 It is used for [[serializing]] and transmitting data over network
connection.
**Supported data types:**
- Number
- String
- Boolean
- Object
- Array
- Null
