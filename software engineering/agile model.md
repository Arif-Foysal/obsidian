Agile methodology takes a different approach from the conventional, linear method.

Agile focuses on howto satisfy the users instead of emphasizing documentation and rigid procedures.

With Agile,
- tasks are broken into short sprints that take about 1 to 4 weeks to complete.
- It’s an iterative model that involves multiple tests as the development progresses.
- Developers continuously seek feedback from customers and make changes to the software.

**Advantages**
- Software has minimal defects due to the iterative effort in testing and fine-tuning.
- Clarity between team members during development, thanks to the frequent and transparent development.
- Changes in project requirements are easily addressed and work on with little impact on the timeline.
- An overall improvement on the deliverable’s quality.

**Disadvantages**
- The team can sometimes lose focus due to overwhelming change requests.
- Documentation takes a back seat in Agile, which can be a problem later on in development.
- Agile focuses on discussions and feedback, which can be too time-consuming for the team.
- Due to its non-structured approach, Agile requires experienced developers who can work independently.

**When to choose Agile methodology**
The Agile methodology is ideal for projects with fast-changing requirements. If you’re building software in a new niche, you’ll want to use Agile. It works best to
implement the additional ideas as you learn more about the market needs. Of course, this assumes that your team of developers is highly independent and comfortable working in a fast-paced, non structured environment.
