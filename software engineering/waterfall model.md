**Key Idea**
- A linear-sequential life cycle model
- Each phase must be completed before the next phase begins.
- There is no overlapping in the phases.
**Advantages**
- Simple and easy way to understand.
- Clearly defined stages.
- Easy to arrange tasks.
- Nice documentation is possible.
- Good for small scale projects.
**Disadvantages**
- Very rigid structure and thus slow
- No working software is produced until the end.
- Cannot accommodate changing requirements.
- It is difficult to measure progress within stages.
- Not a good model for complex or large scale projects.
- High amounts of risk and uncertainity.

**When to choose waterfall?**
Use waterfall only when you have a project with clearly defined scope. It is not suitable for development
that involves many unknowns. Waterfall is ideal for projects with predictable outcomes and when you have a team of inexperienced developers.
