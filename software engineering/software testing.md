## Types of Testing

### Load Testing
- A kind of Performance Testing which determines a system's performance under real-life load conditions.
- Determines systems maximum operating capacity.
- The goal of a load test is to prove that a system can handle the expected volume with minimal to acceptable performance degradation.
### Stress Testing
- Evaluating a system beyond the limits of it's specification.
- Measures the breakpoint of a system.
- When you want to determine how the system behaves under extreme load (DoS) and when it breaks, this is stress testing.

### Regression Testing
Regression testing is selective retesting of a system or component to **verify that modifications have not caused unintended** effects and that the system or component still complies with its specified requirements.

### Static and Dynamic Testing
- Static testing refers to testing something thatâ€™s not running.
- It is sort of examining and reviewing the work. E.g. code review, software inspection are some static testing methods.
- Dynamic Testing involves working with the software, giving input values and checking if the output is as expected.
- Unit Tests, Integration Tests, System Tests and Acceptance Tests are few of the Dynamic Testing methodologies.

## Code Smell
Code smell implies code components that are absolute violations of the fundamentals of developing software that decrease the quality of code.
