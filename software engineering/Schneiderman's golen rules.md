#### Rule 01: strive for consistency
1. Consistent sequence of actions that we perform must be in a similar situation.
2. Usage of Identical terminology in prompts, menus, screens, capitalization, fonts, and layouts must be consistent throughout. 
3. Users should be able to do the same thing in the same way that they have been doing every time.
4. Elements such as fonts, color, shape, and position should be consistently the same in all menus & screens, across, categories for a particular software.
#### Rule 02: enable frequent users to use shortcut

As the frequency of use increases, so do the user's desires to **reduce the number of interactions** and to **increase the pace of interaction**. Abbreviations, function keys, hidden commands, and macro facilities are very helpful to an expert user.
#### Rule 03: offer informative feedback

- Proper feedback should be provided for every user action. For frequent actions, the response can be modest whereas for infrequent actions the response can be substantial.
- Interfaces not just being communicative but also need to help users in terms of learning and feedback which tells them that they are moving in the right direction.
- Unless a user gets feedback. The user is unsure of the correctness of the action.

#### Rule 04: design dialogue to yield closure

- The sequence of actions must be organized clearly into beginning, middle, and end phases.
- Providing feedback to the user after the completion of a group of actions gives the user satisfaction of accomplishment, and a sense of relief, and prepare for the next group of actions.
- The sequence of actions needs to proceed in a dialogue by engaging the user in a step-by-step manner.
- If we consider an example of an e-commerce website that provides users with clear information from selecting a product to the checkout ending with clear information.

#### Rule 05: offer simple error handling

- Make sure the user interface is as user-friendly as possible. such that user doesnâ€™t make any serious errors.
- If the user commits an error the interface should offer simple, comprehensive, and specific instructions for handling the error.
#### Rule 06: permit reversal of actions
- Helps the user to explore unfamiliar options.
- This feature relives anxiety, since the user knows that errors can be undone.
#### Rule 07: Let the user be in control
- Experienced operators strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the system.
- So, users should believe that they are controlling the system and not the way around.
- Design the system to make users the initiators of actions rather than the responder.
#### Rule 08: Reduce the short time memory load on the user
- Humans have limited capacity for processing information in short-term memory.
- The interface design must be in such a way that it should not force users to remember huge amounts of information which make them overwhelmed like remembering information from one display and then using it on another display.
