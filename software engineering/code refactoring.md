## What is refactoring
A refactoring is a software transformation that preserves the external behaviour of the software; improves the internal structure of the software.
It is a disciplined way to clean up code that minimises the
chances of introducing bugs.

## When should you refactor
## When shouldn't you refactor

- **When the existing code is such a mess** that although you could refactor it, it would be easier to rewrite everything from scratch instead.
- **When you are too close to a deadline**. The productivity gain would appear after the deadline and thus be too late.

However, when you are not close to a deadline you should never put off refactoring because you donâ€™t have the time.

Not having enough time usually is a sign that refactoring is
needed.
