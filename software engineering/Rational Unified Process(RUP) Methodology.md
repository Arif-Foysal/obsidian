Rational Unified Process (RUP) is an agile software development method, in which the life cycle of a project, or the development of software, is divided into four phases. Various activities take place during these phases: modelling, analysis and design, implementation, testing and application.

**Phases**
RUP divides the project lifecycle into four distinct phases: **Inception**, **Elaboration**, **Construction**, and **Transition**. Each phase focuses on different aspects of development:

- **Inception**: Defines project scope, requirements, and business case.
- **Elaboration**: Establishes architecture, identifies risks, and refines the project plan.
- **Construction**: Focuses on developing the software system in iterations.
- **Transition**: Prepares the software for deployment and end-user use.

**Advantages**
-  It provides good documentation, it completes the process in itself.
- It provides risk-management support.
- It reuses the components, and hence totaltime duration is less.
- Good online support is available in the form of tutorials and training.

**Disadvantages**
- Team of expert professional is required, as the process is complex.
- Complex and not properly organized process.
- More dependency on risk management.
- Hard to integrate again and again.

**When to choose RUP Methodology**
Whenever you are building a software/system development process, to gather information about what you will need for that process to match what you need in your environment, in order to create the best process for your particular development environment, that will be deployed in an incremental manner. RUP used more often for the development of large, complex, engineered systems.
