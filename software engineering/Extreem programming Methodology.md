Extreme programming, or XP, focuses on frequent releases of software versions within short time frames, allowing the developers to incorporate new requirements as needed with each version.

This methodology relies on regular feedback and open communication with the client to establish these
requirements. XP helps ensure all the members of the development team are aware of the project goals and can align their efforts.
**Advantages**
- The main advantage of Extreme
Programming is that this methodology
allows software development companies
to save costs and time required for project
realization. Time savings are available
because of the fact that XP focuses on the
timely delivery of final products. Extreme
Programming teams save lots of money
because they donâ€™t use too much
documentation. They usually solve
problems through discussions inside of the
team.

- Simplicity is one more advantage of
Extreme Programming projects. The
developers who prefer to use this
methodology create extremely simple code
that can be improved at any moment.
-  The whole process in XP is visible and
accountable.
- Constant feedback is also the strong side.
- XP assists to create software faster thanks to the regular testing at the development stage.

**Disadvantages**
ðŸš«Some specialists say that Extreme
Programming is focused on the code rather
than on design. That may be a problem
because good design is extremely
important for software applications. It
helps sell them in the software market.
Additionally, in XP projects the defect
documentation is not always good. Lack of
defect documentation may lead to the
occurrence of similar bugs in the future.

**When to use Extreme Programming**
- Expect their systemâ€™s functionality to change every few months.
- Experience constantly changing requirements or work with customers who arenâ€™t sure what they want the system to do.
- Want to mitigate project risk, especially around tight deadlines.
- Are able to work closely with customers.
