The spiral model, initially proposed
by Boehm, is an evolutionary
software process model that
couples the iterative feature of
prototyping with the controlled and
systematic aspects of the linear
sequential model. It implements the
potential for rapid development of
new versions of the software.

Using the spiral model, the software
is developed in a series of
incremental releases. During the
early iterations, the additional
release may be a paper model or
prototype. During later iterations,
more and more complete versions
of the engineered system are
produced.

**Advantages**
- High amount of risk analysis
- Useful for large and mission-critical projects.
**Disadvantages**
- Can be a costly model to use.
- Risk analysis needed highly particular expertise
- Doesn't work well for smaller projects.

**When to choose Bohem's Spiral Methodology**
- When deliverance is required to be frequent.
- When the project is large
- When requirements are unclear and complex
- When changes may require at any time
- Large and high budget projects
