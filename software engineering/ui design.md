UI stands for user interface. It is basically the appearance of a software.
Two types of user interfaces-
1. [[graphical user interface (gui)]]
2. [[command line interface (cli)]]

## Usability
The effectiveness with which users can accomplish tasks in a system is measured by-
- Learnability: It is easy to learn?
- Efficiency: Once learned, is it fast to use?
- Safety: Are errors few and recoverable?
### Best practices to achieve usability
- user testing and field studies
- evaluations and reviews by UI experts
- Not getting overwelmed by additional technicalities.
## Why is a good user interface hard to design?
- You are not the user.
	- Most software engineering is about communicating with other programmers.
	- UI is about communicating with users.
- Users are always right
	- Consistent problems are the system's fault.

## Steps in UI Design
- Planning 
- Prototyping and sketching
- Optimization
- Implement
### Planning
- understand the values standing behind our customer
- Brainstorming and research
- Make Feature List
- Plan the navigation
### Sketching and prototyping
- Also known as wireframe modeling
- It is the skeleton of the eventual user interface.
- Can be done
- Manually (paper-pencil, pen tablet)
- Electronically (Adobe XD, Photoshop, Figma)

#### Benefits of Prototyping
- Aids UI implementation
- Help discover requirements
- Help discover test cases and provide a basis for testing
- Allows interaction with user to ensure satisfaction
