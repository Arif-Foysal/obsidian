## ðŸ§  What is a Database Migration?

**Database migration** means **changing your database schema** (structure) â€” like:

- Adding or removing tables
- Adding, renaming, or deleting columns
- Changing data types 
- Renaming constraints or indexes

When you're building an app, your database schema changes over time. Instead of manually changing the database every time (which can cause problems in production), **a migration system** keeps track of all the changes as versioned scripts.
It works like **[[git]] for your database schema**.
