**Intro**
Good morning, everyone. We are here today to present our project Rent Ease, which is a web based home rent system.

Let's take a moment to reflect on the challenges faced by both landlords and tenants in the current home rental market. Landlords often struggle to find suitable tenants, and tenants, on the other hand, face difficulties in discovering the right property that aligns with their needs. The process is time-consuming, inefficient, and can lead to unnecessar y stress for all parties involved.

Our goal is to bridge the gap between landlords and tenants through the implementation of a user-friendly, efficient, and secure Web-Based Home Rental System. This platform is designed to streamline the rental process.
