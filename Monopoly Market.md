A market where there is only one producer or seller, and no close substitute or alternative product exists, is called a monopoly market.

Due to the absence of competition in a monopoly market, the monopolist has significant control over determining the price of the product. The primary goal of the monopolist is to maximize profit.

• There is a single seller and numerous buyers in the market. 
• There are no close substitutes or alternative products. 
• The Average Revenue (AR) and Marginal Revenue (MR) curves slope downward from left to right, and the MR curve lies below the AR curve.
• The producer can influence the price of the product.

Conditions for Equilibrium: To achieve equilibrium, a monopolist follows two conditions: 
• Necessary Condition: The firm's Marginal Revenue (MR) must equal its Marginal Cost (MC), i.e., MR = MC.
• Sufficient Condition: At the equilibrium point, the slope of the MC curve must be greater than the slope of the MR curve, or the MC curve must intersect the MR curve from below and rise upwards.

Additional Conditions: Profit ultimately depends on the firm's cost structure, particularly the Average Cost (AC). 
• When P > AC or AR > AC, the firm earns super-normal profit. 
• When P = AC or AR = AC, the firm achieves normal profit. 
• When P < AC or AR < AC, the firm incurs a loss, as it fails to cover its total cost.
