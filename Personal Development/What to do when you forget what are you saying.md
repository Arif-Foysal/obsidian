- **Planned Spontaneity**
	In case you've forgotten a point that you waned to speak about, instead of going from point 1 to point 2, go from point 1 to point 3 and then point 2. This can be done by saying- 
		`I think it would be better if we go into the third point first.`
- **Repeat what you just said in a different way**
	You can always buy some time by saying what you just said in a [[Paraphrasing | paraphrased]] manner. You can also give some examples of what you just explained.
- **Do not have your entire script while speaking** 
	You may often forget where you are in the script. So it can make a really awkward situation finding your place in the entire script.
	So instead of bringing whole script, just have the key points of the script. Check the key points in case you forget what next.
- **Remember that your audience don't know what you're gonna say next**
	Always remember that you can direct the speech to any way you want to and they don't know what's next.
- **Use Q&A to your advantage**
