The term "acronym" refers to a word formed from the initial letters or parts of a longer phrase. Acronyms are often used as convenient abbreviations or mnemonics in various fields, including technology, government, medicine, and more. Acronyms are typically pronounced as a word themselves, such as NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) or laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). It's worth noting that not all abbreviations are acronyms, as some abbreviations are pronounced letter-by-letter, like "FBI" (Federal Bureau of Investigation).
