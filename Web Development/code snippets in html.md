#html 

The `<pre>` tag in HTML preserves the original formatting of text, making it an excellent choice for displaying code where spacing and indentation are key.

```html
<pre>
    <!-- code snippet in any programming language -->
</pre>
```

### **Key Features**
- The `<pre>` tag maintains both spaces and line breaks, ensuring that text appears exactly as it was originally formatted.
- The `<pre>` tag has both an opening tag `<pre>` and a closing tag `</pre>`.
- Additional attributes can also be added for further customization.
### **Displaying a Simple Python Program and Its Output**

In this section, we will use HTML to display a simple Python program that prints 'Hello, World!' to the console. Don't worry, you don't need to know Python; we're just showing how to display the program using the HTML `<pre>` tag.

### **Python Program**

```html
<pre>
  # A simple Python program to print "Hello, World!"
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</pre>
```

**Output:**

<pre>
  # A simple Python program to print "Hello, World!"
def main():
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</pre>
