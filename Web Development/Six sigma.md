### Six Sigma
Six Sigma is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement.

**Objective**: The goal of Six Sigma is to improve the quality of processes by identifying and removing the causes of defects and **minimizing variability** in manufacturing and business processes.

Six Sigma can be applied to any process in any industry to establish a management system for identifying errors and eliminating them.


#### 5 Six sigma principles

1. **Customer Focus**
2. **Access the value chain and find the problem**
3. **Eliminate defects and outliers**
4. **Involve stakeholders**
5. **Flexible and responsive system**

| Phase                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Define opportunities    | Determine customer and core processes. Determine the customer's requirements for the products and services being produced. Map the processes that are being improved. Gain the customer's commitment.                                                                         |
| Measure performance     | Develop a plan to collect and measure the defect data. Collect data from many sources in the organization and determine the defect rates and other metrics. Compile and display the data.                                                                                       |
| Analyze opportunity     | Analyze and verify the data collected. Determine the root causes for the defects and identify opportunities for improvement. Prioritize the improvement opportunities.                                                                                                          |
| Improve performance     | Design creative solutions to improve the processes. Create a problem statement and a solution statement for each problem. Test specific improvements with an experimental approach. Deploy the improvements.                                                                    |
| Control performance     | Monitor the improvement programs to control them. Develop an ongoing monitoring plan to keep the process on the new course and prevent it from reverting to its previous state. Assess the effectiveness of the improvement. Develop staffing and training incentives to make the improvements permanent. |

**The 5 whys**
Five Whys, sometimes written as "5 Whys," is a guided team exercise for identifying the root cause of a  problem. Five Whys is used in the "analyze" phase of the Six Sigma DMAIC (define, measure, **analyze**, improve, control)
Example :
1. Why is the company in the red last quarter?
2. Why were there a lot of charge?
3. Why were they dissatisfied with the product?
4. Why were the products defective?
5. Why were there malfunctions?

##### DMADV
DMADV focuses on the development of an entirely new process, product, or service. It is used when existing processes, even after improvement, do not satisfy the customer’s needs, and new methods are required to be developed. It comprises five phases:
1. Define the purpose of the project, product, or service
2. Measure the crucial components of a process and product capabilities
3. Analyze data and develop design alternatives, ultimately selecting the best design
4. Design the selected best alternative and test the prototype
5. Verify the effectiveness of the design through several simulations and a pilot program

#### Six sigma defective rates

The chart here explains the defect rates at different sigma levels:

- **±3 sigma**: 0.27% defects or 2700 defects per million (ppm).
- **±4 sigma**: 63 ppm.
- **±6 sigma**: Only 0.002 ppm, which translates to 3.4 defects per million opportunities, representing the ultimate goal of Six Sigma—near-zero defects.

#### Lean Six Sigma
**Lean Six Sigma** combines the strategies of **Lean** (which focuses on **reducing waste** and **improving process speed**) and **Six Sigma** (which focuses on **reducing variability** and defects and improving process quality).
