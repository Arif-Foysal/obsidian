A calculator company produces a scientific calculator and a graphing calculator. Long-term projections indicate an expected demand of at least 100 scientific and 80 graphing calculators each day. Because of limitations on production capacity, no more than 200 scientific and 170 graphing calculators can be made daily. To satisfy a shipping contract, a total of at least 200 calculators much be shipped each day. If each scientific calculator sold results in a $2 loss, but each graphing calculator produces a $5 profit, how many of each type should be made daily to maximize net profits?

#### **Sol:**

- **Products**: Scientific calculators and graphing calculators.
- **Expected Demand**:
    - At least 100 scientific calculators.
    - At least 80 graphing calculators.
- **Production Capacity**:
    - No more than 200 scientific calculators can be produced daily.
    - No more than 170 graphing calculators can be produced daily.
- **Shipping Requirement**:
    - A total of at least 200 calculators (scientific + graphing) must be shipped daily.
- **Profit**:
    - Producing one scientific calculator results in a loss of $2.
    - Each graphing calculator provides a profit of $5.
- **Objective**: Determine how many of each type of calculator should be produced daily to maximize net profit.


Maximize `z`=−2x+5y

Where:

- x = number of scientific calculators produced.
- y = number of graphing calculators produced.
- The term "-2x" indicates a $2 loss per scientific calculator.
- The term "5y" indicates a $5 profit per graphing calculator.
##### **Constraints**:

1. x ≥ 100 (At least 100 scientific calculators must be produced)
2. y ≥ 80 (At least 80 graphing calculators must be produced)
3. x ≤ 200 (No more than 200 scientific calculators can be produced)
4. y ≤ 170 (No more than 170 graphing calculators can be produced)
5. x+y ≥ 200 (At least 200 calculators must be shipped daily)

**Plotting x+y >= 200**
first plot x+y = 200 (the line)
then put the arrow sign perpendicular direction.
x intersection:
x = 0,
0+y = 200
y=200
y intersection:
y=0,
x+0 = 200
x=200

Here, 
A(100, 170)
D(200, 80)

**Finding B and C:**
x+y = 200 ----(1)
x = 100 -----(2)
solving for y,
y = 200-100 = 100

So, 
B(100, 100)

For C,
y = 80 ----(3)
solving for x,
x + 80 = 200
x = 200 - 80 = 120
So,
C(120, 80)

**We need to choose A(100, 170). Cause it gives maximum value for z, with the equation z = -2x + 5y**
