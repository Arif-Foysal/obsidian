HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. This is another way to set colour properties.

Breaking each keyword:

### Hue(h)

- Hue represents the type of color. It is measured in degrees, and its value lies from 0 to 360.
- 0 degree represents black, 120 degree is for green, and 360 degree is for blue.

### Saturation (S):

- Saturation controls the intensity or purity of the color. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
- 0% saturation is no color (grayscale),Â  and 100% saturation is the most intense colour.

### Lightness (L):

- Lightness determines how light or dark the colour is. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
- 0% lightness represents pure black, 50% lightness represents normal colour, and 100% lightness is pure white.

#### Syntax:

```css
selector{
       color: hsl(hue, saturation, lightness);
}
```
