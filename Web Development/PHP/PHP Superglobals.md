Superglobals are built-in variables that are always available in all [[PHP Variables#PHP Variables Scope|scopes]]. 
There is no need to do `global $variable;` to access them within functions or methods.

The PHP superglobal variables are:
```
$GLOBALS
$_SERVER
$_REQUEST
$_POST
$_GET
$_FILES
$_ENV
$_COOKIE
$_SESSION
```

![[PHP $GLOBALS]]
