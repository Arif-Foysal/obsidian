### **Corporate Strategy**

There are 3 types of corporate strategy:
- **Growth**
	- Concentration
	- Vertical Integration
	- Horizontal Integration
	- Diversification
- **Stability**
- **Renewal**

#### **Growth**
##### **Concentration**
An  organization  that grows using concentration focuses on its primary line of business and increases the number of products offered or markets served in this primary business.

##### **Vertical Integration**
- **Backward:**
	When you become the supplier. e.g. British American Tobacco
- **Forward:**
	When you become the retailer. e.g. Apple has their own retail store
##### **Horizontal Integration**

when a company grows by combining with competitors
##### **Diversification**
When a company diversifies its business into many areas.
#### **Stability**
a corporate strategy in which an organization continues to do what it is currently doing. Examples of this strategy include continuing to serve the same clients by offering the same product or service, maintaining market share, and sustaining the organization’s current business operations. The organization doesn’t grow, but doesn’t fall behind, either.

#### **Renewal Strategy**
- Cut Costs
- Restructure organizational operations

In [[1999]], IBM concluded that while it was once again a stable business following a near-death experience five years earlier, it had lost its ability to innovate, something dozens of new competitors (including Cisco and Akamai) didn’t hesitate to seize upon. Yet over the past 14 years, IBM has become a new company. It has successfully moved away from hardware and software and refocused itself around consulting, analytics and industry- specific solutions. 


### **Company Portfolio Management BCG Matrix**
When an organization runs several businesses, managers can manage this collection of businesses using a tool called a **corporate portfolio matrix**.

This matrix provides a framework for understanding diverse businesses and helps managers establish priorities for allocating resources.

The first portfolio matrix—the BCG matrix—was developed by the Boston Consulting Group and introduced the idea that an organization’s various businesses could be evaluated and plotted using a `2x2` matrix to identify which ones offered high potential and which were a drain on organizational resources. 

The horizontal axis represents market share (low or high) and the vertical axis indicates anticipated market growth (low or high).
