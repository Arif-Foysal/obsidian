## The \<script> Tag
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between `<script>` and `</script>` tags.

### Example
```js
<script>  
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";  
</script>
```
## External References

An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:
- With a full URL (a full web address)
- With a file path (like /js/)
- Without any path
This example uses a **full URL** to link to myScript.js:
```js
	<script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>
```
