### **Marketing Mix**\
**4 P's of marketing**
When marketing their products and services, organizations need to create a successful mix of:
1. Product
2. Price 
3. Promotion
4. Place

You just need to **create a product** that a particular group of people want, put it on sale **some place** that those same people visit regularly, and **price** it at a level which matches the value they feel they get out of it; and do all that in a way so they want to buy.

### **Mass Marketing and Micro Marketing**
**Mass Marketing**
In mass marketing, the seller engages in the mass production, mass distribution and mass promotion of one product to all buyers.

**Micro Marketing**
Micro marketing is a targeted marketing strategy that aimed at specific group of consumers within a market. Unlike mass marketing, which targets a broad audience, micro marketing focuses on a smaller, highly defined segment of the market.
#### **Levels of micro-marketing**
Micro marketing has 4 levels:
1. Segment Marketing
2. Niche Marketing
3. Local Marketing
4. Individual Marketing

**Segment Marketing:** A market segment consists of a group of consumers who share similar set of needs and wants.
For example:
- Vim bar for economy class.
- Vim liquid for premium segment.

**Niche Marketing:** A special type of segment who need products that possess some unique characteristics. They are ready to pay premium prices for the products they need.
Niche segment is very small in size and a sensitive segment, as they are paying premium price they will definitely be more demanding.
For example:
- Gluten free food products
- Swimming accessories such as swim suit, breathing device etc.
- Prosthetic body-parts for people with special needs.

**Local Marketing:**
Local marketing is based on the needs and wants of **local consumer** groups in trading areas or neighborhood.
For example:
- Movie released with local dubbing.

**Individual Marketing:**
The ultimate level of segmentation leads to "**one-to-one**" marketing or customized marketing for each individual. 
For example:
- Asian-Paints provide any color that an individual customer wants.
- Burger with customized ingredients.

### **Brand and Brand Equity**
**What is a brand?**
Brand is a name, term, sign, symbol, design or a combination of them, intended to identify the goods and services of one seller and to differentiate them from those of competitors.

**Brand Equity**
Brand  equity is the added value endowed on product and services. It may be reflected in the way customers think, feel and act with respect to the brand, prices & market share.

### **Some Interesting Marketing Strategies**
An advertising strategy that focuses on low-cost unconventional marketing tactics that yield maximum results. This involves high energy and imagination focusing on grasping the attention of the public in more personal and memorable level.
The main point of guerrilla marketing is that the activities are done exclusively on the streets or other public places, such as shopping centers, parks or beaches with maximum people access so as to attract a bigger audience.

### **Grey Marketing**
Grey marketing involves the sale of genuine products through unauthorized channels. These products are often obtained legally but sold outside the manufacturerâ€™s authorized distribution networks.
**For example:** Sale of unofficial smartphones in Bangladesh

### **Black Marketing**
Black marketing involves the illegal sale of goods and services, typically in violation of laws and regulations.

**Black market vs grey market**
Grey marketing bypasses authorized distribution channels but typically does not involve illegal goods. Black marketing is inherently illegal and involves evasion of laws and regulations.
