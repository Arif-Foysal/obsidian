### **1. Total Revenue (TR)**

- **What it is:** Total income from sales.
- **Formula:**
    TR = PriceÃ—Quantity = PÃ—Q
- **Example:**  
    Selling 100 loaves at $5 each â†’
    TR = 100Ã—5 = $500
### **2. Average Revenue (AR)**

- **What it is:** Revenue earned **per unit** sold.
- **Formula:**
    
    AR=TR/Q
- **Example:**
    
    AR=500/100=$5
- In most cases, **AR = Price**.
### **3. Marginal Revenue (MR)**

- **What it is:** Extra revenue from selling **one more unit**.
    
- **Formula:**
    
    MR=Î”TR / Î”Q
- **Example:**  
    TR increases from $500 to $505 when selling 1 more loaf â†’
    
    MR=505âˆ’500=$5

## ðŸ“˜ **Part 2: Revenue in Different Market Structures**

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Perfect Competition**

- Firms **canâ€™t set prices** (price-takers).
- The **price stays the same** no matter how much you sell.
- **TR increases linearly** with output.
    
- **AR = MR = Price**  
    Example:  
    If Price = $10
    
    - Selling 10 units â†’ TR = $100
        
    - Selling 11 units â†’ TR = $110
        
    - MR = $10

### ðŸ”¸ **2. Imperfect Competition (Monopoly, Oligopoly, etc.)**

- Firms **can set prices** (price-makers).
- **To sell more, they must lower the price.**
- TR follows a **curve**:
    - Increases, hits a max, then may decrease.
- **AR decreases** as output increases.
- **MR < AR** and also decreases.
    

**Example:**

- Selling 10 units at $10 â†’ TR = $100
    
- To sell 11 units, price drops to $9  
    â†’ New TR = $99  
    â†’ MR = -$1 (bad!)
