### Green computing and your reputation


1. Explain the concept of greenwash with 4 real life examples. What steps an organization can take to avoid greenwash?
	
	Ans:
	**Greenwashing** is when a company falsely claims or exaggerates its environmental benefits to appear more eco-friendly than it actually is.
	### **Steps to Avoid Greenwashing and Ensure Transparency**
	
	1. **Be Honest and Transparent**
	    
	    - Provide clear, specific, and verifiable claims about sustainability efforts. Avoid vague terms like "eco-friendly" without data or certification to back it up.
	    - Example: Instead of saying "sustainable," provide metrics like "100% of our products are made from recycled materials."
	2. **Third-Party Certifications**
	    
	    - Obtain recognized certifications such as **Fair Trade**, **LEED**, **Energy Star**, or **Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)** to substantiate environmental claims. These certifications ensure an independent verification of the company’s sustainability practices.
	3. **Measure and Report Environmental Impact**
	    
	    - Regularly publish **Environmental Impact Reports** that track specific sustainability goals, including carbon emissions, energy usage, and waste reduction.
	    - Example: Share annual sustainability reports with measurable progress and future goals to show a commitment to continuous improvement.
	4. **Set Realistic Goals**
	    
	    - Ensure sustainability goals are feasible, actionable, and time-bound. Avoid over-promising or setting unrealistic targets that cannot be met.
	    - Example: Pledge to reduce carbon emissions by a specific percentage within a defined period rather than vague goals like "we aim to be carbon-neutral."
	5. **Engage in Full Lifecycle Analysis**
	    
	    - Consider the environmental impact of a product across its entire lifecycle, from raw materials to disposal. Being transparent about these factors helps build trust with consumers.
	    - Example: A company can offer a detailed breakdown of how its products are sourced, produced, used, and disposed of.

	**Ans:**
	Reputation management refers to the strategies used by organizations to maintain a positive public image.
	
	**Sustainibility-led:**
	 A **sustainability-led** approach means that sustainability is at the core of an organization’s mission and operations. Companies following this model prioritize environmental impact in decision-making, innovation, and business strategy.
	 
	 **Sustainability-supported:**
	 Integrates sustainability into existing operations without making it the primary focus. While the company supports green initiatives, its core mission may be different.
	 
	 
	**Sustainability as a Plus:**
	This approach treats sustainability as an additional benefit rather than a core value. Companies in this category may implement green practices as a marketing advantage or to comply with regulations, but sustainability is not their main driver.
