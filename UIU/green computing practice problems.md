	- Set emission reduction goals and optimize workloads accordingly.
	
	#### **7. Sustainable Software Development**
	
	- Develop energy-efficient applications by optimizing code and reducing computational complexity.
	- Use serverless computing to run functions only when needed, minimizing idle resource consumption.
	
	#### **8. Edge Computing and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
	
	- Reduce data transfer energy costs by using edge computing to process data closer to the source.
	- Implement CDNs to cache and serve content from geographically distributed servers, reducing redundant data movement.


2. Explain briefly how edge computing facilitates towards the green computing environment.
   **Ans:** 
   Edge computing is a distributed computing model that processes data closer to the source (e.g., IoT devices, sensors, or local servers) instead of relying on centralized cloud data centers.
   Edge computing supports green computing by reducing energy consumption, minimizing data transfer, and optimizing resource use. It processes data closer to the source, decreasing reliance on energy-intensive cloud data centers.
	### **Key Benefits:**
	
	1. **Lower Energy Use:** Reduces data transmission and cloud processing power.
	2. **Improved Efficiency:** Enables real-time processing, cutting redundant computations.
	3. **Reduced Data Center Load:** Minimizes reliance on large, power-hungry cloud servers.
	4. **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Only necessary data is sent to the cloud.
	5. **Supports Renewable Energy:** Can be powered by localized solar or wind energy.

3. What is green computing? Explain the importance of Green computing practices based on the UN’s sustainable development goal (SDG).
   **Ans:**
   Green computing refers to the environmentally responsible use of computing resources.
	Green computing supports several **UN SDGs** by promoting sustainability in technology. Key contributions include:
	[[Sustainable Development Goals(SDG)]]
1. **SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy**
    
    - Encourages energy-efficient IT infrastructure.
    - Supports the use of renewable energy in data centers.
2. **SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**
    
    - Promotes sustainable and resilient IT systems.
    - Encourages innovation in eco-friendly computing solutions.
3. **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**
    
    - Reduces e-waste through recycling and responsible disposal.
    - Encourages sustainable manufacturing of IT products.
4. **SDG 13: Climate Action**
    
    - Minimizes carbon footprint by optimizing energy use in computing.
    - Promotes green cloud computing and energy-efficient algorithms.
5. **SDG 15: Life on Land**
    
    - Reduces environmental pollution from hazardous electronic waste.
    - Promotes the sustainable use of natural resources in IT hardware production.


4. Briefly explain the concept of Cloud in a box.
   **Ans:**
   **Cloud in a Box** refers to a **pre-configured, self-contained cloud infrastructure** that provides cloud computing capabilities in a compact, on-premises solution. It includes servers, storage, networking, and virtualization software, allowing organizations to deploy a private or hybrid cloud environment quickly without relying on external cloud providers.
   
### Green computing and your reputation


1. Explain the concept of greenwash with 4 real life examples. What steps an organization can take to avoid greenwash?
	
	Ans:
	**Greenwashing** is when a company falsely claims or exaggerates its environmental benefits to appear more eco-friendly than it actually is.
	### **Steps to Avoid Greenwashing and Ensure Transparency**
	
	1. **Be Honest and Transparent**
	    
	    - Provide clear, specific, and verifiable claims about sustainability efforts. Avoid vague terms like "eco-friendly" without data or certification to back it up.
	    - Example: Instead of saying "sustainable," provide metrics like "100% of our products are made from recycled materials."
	2. **Third-Party Certifications**
	    
	    - Obtain recognized certifications such as **Fair Trade**, **LEED**, **Energy Star**, or **Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)** to substantiate environmental claims. These certifications ensure an independent verification of the company’s sustainability practices.
	3. **Measure and Report Environmental Impact**
	    
	    - Regularly publish **Environmental Impact Reports** that track specific sustainability goals, including carbon emissions, energy usage, and waste reduction.
	    - Example: Share annual sustainability reports with measurable progress and future goals to show a commitment to continuous improvement.
	4. **Set Realistic Goals**
	    
	    - Ensure sustainability goals are feasible, actionable, and time-bound. Avoid over-promising or setting unrealistic targets that cannot be met.
	    - Example: Pledge to reduce carbon emissions by a specific percentage within a defined period rather than vague goals like "we aim to be carbon-neutral."
	5. **Engage in Full Lifecycle Analysis**
	    
	    - Consider the environmental impact of a product across its entire lifecycle, from raw materials to disposal. Being transparent about these factors helps build trust with consumers.
	    - Example: A company can offer a detailed breakdown of how its products are sourced, produced, used, and disposed of.
	
2. **State** reputation management. Why reputation is important for Green Computing?  
	**Explain** the following terms in details:
	
	i. Sustainability-led  
	ii. Sustainability-supported and  
	iii. Sustainability as a Plus
	**Ans:**
	Reputation management refers to the strategies used by organizations to maintain a positive public image.
	
	**Sustainibility-led:**
	 A **sustainability-led** approach means that sustainability is at the core of an organization’s mission and operations. Companies following this model prioritize environmental impact in decision-making, innovation, and business strategy.
	 
	 **Sustainability-supported:**
	 Integrates sustainability into existing operations without making it the primary focus. While the company supports green initiatives, its core mission may be different.
	 
	 
	**Sustainability as a Plus:**
	This approach treats sustainability as an additional benefit rather than a core value. Companies in this category may implement green practices as a marketing advantage or to comply with regulations, but sustainability is not their main driver.
