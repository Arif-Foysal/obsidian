The event-driven architecture pattern is a popular **distributed** **asynchronous** architecture pattern used to produce highly scalable applications. It is also highly adaptable and can be used for small applications and as well as large, complex ones.

## Key Features
- Highly decoupled and scalable.
- Requires contracts (e.g., data formats) for communication.
	 Layers must agree on how data is structured and passed between them (e.g., JSON, XML, or specific database schemas). 

## Types of event-driven architectures
- **Mediator**: Central orchestrator for high-complexity event processing.
- **Broker**: Facilitates decentralized, chained event handling with minimal orchestration.
